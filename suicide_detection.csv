"Are Sleeping Pills good for a 15 year old? Help For months I have been struggling to fall asleep and I also been starting to hallucinate because of my terrible insomnia but when I fall asleep I get nightmares and and it’s just like a story inside my head that continues on and on. So I’m trying to not to sleep because I’m scared that the nightmares still continues. I’ve been thinking to buy them without my parents permission (hopefully not to dream) because i don’t want to worry them about it because my parents are already in stress about searching houses and a school and a lot of bullshit, and I already know they might say no...But I just want to know if it’s really dangerous for a kid to take sleeping pills without a doctor to know.",non-suicide

"I dont like DOOM eternal.... Don't get me wrong, it's a hella fun game. But I hate the idea of the Doom Slayer. Back in DOOM 2016, all we saw on the doomguy was his mask and a suit of armor. With no face, no image on the body, no dialogue, only revealing the armor, it feels like doomguy has no soul. Doomguy doesn't seem like a person, but an embodiment of the intent on vengeance. With no face or Body, it leaves us with our own imagination what the doomguy looks like, and through our own personal preference and imagination, it feels like YOU are the  doomslayer. . . But Doom Eternal changes all that, from a silent embodiment of intention to just a buff human. Doom 2016 makes us feel the power comes from pure intention and malice, but it is revealed in DOOM ETERNAL that all we are is just a drugged guy with severe psychotic PTSD.. . When doomguy talked in the flashback, it makes him seem weak and helpless. When his face was revealed, he doesn't seem deadly and hateful, just another protagonist from the sea of endless averages.. . It's basically revealing V's face from V for Vendetta, from an embodiment of intention to a drugged, mentally impaired human.",non-suicide

"Male Privilege again... I made a post about male privilege earlier, but I didn’t quite explain what it is.. . Male privilege is being able to walk the streets without the fear of harassment. It’s being able to walk past a group of fellow men without fear of verbal or physical harassment. Male privilege is feeling safer than women. Overall male privilege is the lack of fear in public, doing things in public without fear. Without the fear of being raped, cat called by a creepy guy on a corner. . . I experience male privilege, and I’ve only just learnt what it is through my sister. Her telling me how she has to be extra cautious in public. She basically can’t walk alone at night without the inevitable fear of being raped. . . I’m looking to better myself, to make a statement for men to understand. Don’t be a fuckwit to women on the streets, imagine going about your daily business. A stranger does something than an instant chill of vulnerability and weakness comes over you. That’s what my sister described male privilege as not being worried by the small things. But for men they may be small but for others they are huge.. . Be better boys, for the people you love. Your mother, sister, girlfriend or friends. . . Cut the snarky remarks, try to be less intimidating.. . Be better that’s all I’m asking.",non-suicide

"My feelings, and trust your gut (meta)I suppose I should introduce myself. I'm /u/mercurial_illusion and I've been through and helped people with a couple of life shattering suicides in the past year. The one that has affected me the most was my father back in September. I look back at these and wonder if there was something I missed or if there was something I could have done and the answer in reality, as hard as it is to accept is ""Not really"". Sure there were hints (there almost always are) but those hints come from people who aren't struggling with these problems as well. The only reason I've made it through is the old adage ""Fake it 'till you make it"" and I've been faking it hardcore. I'm not okay but I will be one day.. . I've had a few friends that have done things that make me worry about them. I've finally gathered the courage to talk to them and most have talked me down (which I'm not opposed to) but one has hit me up saying he talked to the suicide hotline and thanked me for my involvement. 1 out of 6. That's below the Mendoza line (baseball reference, if you don't get it it's not important) but even if it were 1/1000 I'd be happy.. . I guess my message is if you know somebody who you think is having problems then talk to them. The worst that can happen is they tell you they're fine but they WILL know you care about them. Help is so easy to give because all it takes is time and if you're not equipped there are plenty of people are are that are just a phone call away. We all lose hope from time to time but we can all help even if it's just letting somebody know we care. That fact alone is enough to change the course of somebody's life and it takes nothing. . . I guess this is enough rambling from an arthritic old man. I guess my point is that you can help and anything you can do, no matter how insignificant it feels to you, can be the difference between a drastic choice and giving something a shot. Never give up.",suicide
"I'm a monster.This has been bothering me all my life.. . Long time lurker first time posting here. I feel I'm at wits end. And the funny thing is, is I don't feel like, super depressed or anxious. I feel fine today, albeit a little...empty. I woke up in a lot of pain, but besides that, I'm perfectly okay. Which is why I'm so confused as to why I have this seemingly unending death wish - even when I'm okay. I'm laughing now, writing this, because what threw me off balance today, was my back pain. It's funny, a slight inconvenience is enough to make me want to want me to kill myself.. . I thought I had an okay life. I mean, I'm a published author and musician, but I suck at it. I used to be a straight A student but I'm not anymore. I'm in University and have plans to become a doctor. Not really my plans but my parents plans. I personally want to be a musician. It's all I want. Music is the only thing that doesn't make me feel like a monster.. . After Hurricane Katrina destroyed my home in 2005, I was excited to move and practically start my life over. My father stayed home, and my mom and siblings hopped from state to state until settling down, without my father. I expected a new start to life, I was genuinely excited. I wasn't expecting to get molested and raped, however. I'm a male, and on that day, I never truly felt the same. I was young, and it shaped me into what I am today, which is not a good thing.. . I've been bullied the vast majority of my life for my religion. I'm Muslim and was always on the ass end of an ass kicking, or the ass end of a bomb joke, or 9/11 joke. I never really took it to heart as a kid, but lately, it's been coming back into my adult life, and it feels like 4th grade P.E. all over again.. . When I was 15, I was diagnosed with a tumor (specifically, a hemangioma - collection of blood cells - on my T4 vertebrae of my spine) and had to have been operated on immediately. After a year of medication, blood work, hospital stays, countless MRI's and CAT scans, and 3 surgeries later, I was cancer free. I never had any chemotherapy, as my family didn't want it.. . Growing up with cancer in my highschool days, I was never upset. I was actually...relieved. I honestly thought I was gonna die. I never told anyone, of course, but deep down, I hoped the cancer would kill me. I wasn't upset, just. Relieved. Like when you're on a road trip and you really, really need to pee, and you finally stop and feel that whole sensation of relief taking hold of your body. That's what I long for.. . I went through the remainder of my highschool years in a neck and back brace, which certainly didn't help my case. Since my surgeries, I've been in a great deal of pain. I thought I could turn to drugs to take the pain away, but now the drugs kinda just. Took over. It's not a huge problem, but it most certainly is a problem.. . And my most hated problem of all, is I'm guilty of a crime. I don't want to explain it, but. I've hurt someome, sexually, in the same regard I was hurt sexually, growing up. I thought I was doing the right thing. But I learned. I learned that what I did was wrong, and that I hurt that poor soul probably more than I've been hurt. And I wish I could rectify my mistakes. God, if there was a way to undo my entire life, fucking show me the way. I'm a monster, and I just want an end to this fucking circus that is my life.. . To whom I've hurt. I'm truly sorry, and nothing will ever forgive me. I just wish I could have some modicum of forgiveness, and be told that it's all okay. But this isn't a fairy tale - it's real life. And real life isn't sunshine and happiness, or unicorns and rainbows. It's fucking dank, miserable, and unforgiving. I'm only glad that I learned that earlier rather than later.. . I don't know what I'm to do with myself. I hope I find a way out of this life. I wish I had the balls to do it myself.",suicide
"I’m just so tiredHi, I’m kind of nervous so this may be everywhere. . I have no one really to talk to because I either push them away or tell them too much to where they don’t want to be associated with me. I have no friends, so no one to mourn me if I die. I have an intense fear of abandonment, which has gotten so bad to the point where I would do reckless behaviors in order to keep someone from leaving me (they always end up leaving anyways). . I also have no social skills, so I’m extremely awkward. I can’t hold a conversation and I’ve been told I don’t talk about anything so people use that as an excuse to not talk to me at all. . I feel like I was handed the short hand of the stick in life. Every bad trait that you wouldn’t want in a person is me. And I try to pretend like I don’t care but that only makes me feel worse. I’ve been having suicidal thoughts more frequently, but I’m scared to voice them because I know people are tired of my shit. I’m tired of it too. ",suicide

He's an asshole who doesn't give a shit about anyone but himself this guy.That's besides the fact now. Killing myself crosses my mind every single day, I can't remember a day that has passed when I haven't thought about it at least once. I've told my doctor this, all he says is here, take these. The only reason I haven't gone through with it is because of my parents. The last thing I want is for them to feel the brunt of it. My mother is the same as me at this point, she was crying tonight talking about how she feels unloved and all her problems stemming from her father, it really upset me. . . Tonight my brother called me to tell me that he was staying out and to tell my parents that he was staying out because they weren;t answering. I said okay. As I walked up to the house the thoughr crossed my mind, Maybe they killed themselves, maybe they died somehow. I love these people but at the same time I felt if that happened, I myself would be relieved because I could finally do what I need to do. I want to wait until they die until I do it but I feel I can't wait any longer. It's going to be at least a decade and I can't wait that long. I have no idea how I feel, it's a numb feeling if anything. I just wish sometimes I didn't care about them so I wouldn't feel bad about this. . . As cliche as it sounds, I myself am nothing in this huge system of life throughout. I don't see myself going to heaven or hell when I do it. I see myself becoming nothing, just ceasing to exist, and It gives me a great feeling when I think about it. . . I'm a college senior who is doing very well but I still see nothing for me, I don't want it. I drink myself to the point where I don't know who I am because it makes me feel at peace. At the same time I'll put myself through it inhopes I can pull a Nicholas cage in ""Leaving las Vegas"" and drink myself to death. . . The way I feel is too much to put into words at this point. I'm writing here because I am reaching out for help. Everyday for me is a day I don't want to live and it's getting to the point where I think I know what needs to happen.

I just want to list down the reasons why I feel like I want to kill myself over. So let’s start: got no real purpose over here. Jidr hawa udhr mein? More or less. People are shit. Mtlb akheer level chutiye takrey jb bhi takrey. *Kya itna bura hoo mein, maa?* My sis-es are even shittier give or take. They had/have their peak moments but they make me feel like shit too. I push everyone away as a defense mechanism or I simply find everyone annoying. Cannot really vibe? Getting me? Mutual vibration? Sounds like mutual masturbation- oh well. I need a hug. A read bad fucking hug. But hai koi joi de skey? Besides the Jinn I might have made sad and annoyed with my intensive crying and breakdown – nada. None. Empty set. Null pointer. Phi. Every time I have tried to sleep tonight, I end up crying. And hence not getting any sleep? No shit Sherlock. But I do need my sleep otherwise that ugly blackout might come back. Ugh. I want to kill myself. The only reason not to are so fucking the reasons why I do want to kill myself for? For instance, they would be sad forever. Their jawan jahan beti, who never showed sign of mental stress (sarcasm) committed suicide? Wese falling from the chatt, would be painfully erotic and fun. I used the word erotic because I cannot think of any other fancy word for fun. Moving on, since, the backside, has walls and gamley, either I will hit the wall. Or the gamla. Or accidentally die and hit saath waley logo k ghar ki side wali dewaar (becharay). See how I say accidentally. LOL. It hurts. At this point, I am not sure what does? You acted so selfish, just to ease out of your guilt, you did this to me. Again. And it is funny how I am reacting to it. My head feels like it will explode. I cannot take more crying of today. It was so hard to control myself today. I feel like if I hadn’t it wouldn’t have been this bad. The pain would have just numbed the hurt and I would be sleeping in pain rn. That would have been better than anything I am feeling rn. Would give anything tobe numb rn. I swear. BC koi sleeping/drowsy pills hi ni mili ghar ein. I would drowned that and tried to sleep.

This is because of the obvious practical implications. At the point in my life where it can be said that I was first able to consider my existence properly, it was already too late. I have already become tangled in a net of people who care. Their purest wishes, for which I cannot fault them, coerce me into a life that I do not want. For if they were to stop caring, and if I could put myself where nobody would have the distress of discovering my body, I would not even hesitate.. . And there is anger, because I do not want a life. I do not want to put in the effort that it would take to process myself through therapy and become a functional human being. I am not saying that it is impossible for me to be happy. I feel that if I were to co operate with such entities, and have us work together to fix myself, I would likely become happy and productive. What I am actually saying is that I do not want it. I do not want to improve myself, nor do I want to cause distress. Given that I am not willing to compromise on my wishes, there can be no movement in this. I am angry like a trapped beast, because that is what I am. So I am angry only at myself. My pitiful, weak, ridiculous self. Maybe that is the cruellest trick fate has dealt me.

The love of my life that I spent five and a half years with has recently told me that she doesn't love me anymore, and that she hasn't been happy in a while. Now, I had always been really good at telling how she had been feeling, and I can tell you that she got really, really good at pretending to be happy to fool me.. . Since then, I've had trouble keeping up at work, my bills have fallen behind, and I'm noticing that all of my friends are entirely too selfish to help me out. I have many friends, but the only one that ever really knew me was her, and though we are trying to be friends and I am trying to talk to her, every moment that I do I start to feel worse and worse.. . I have some short-term goals I would like to see through, such as finishing my novel (and perhaps the sequels). But beyond those, I see no reason to keep going. I believe it was George Eastman, inventor of the roll film, whom, before ending his own life by gunshot, left a note saying ""My work is done. Why wait?"". .

"Pretty much done.[Really long, might not be clear, sorry. I'm not exactly in a good state of mind to be typing out my thoughts right now, so please do forgive me.]. . . I just turned 16 last October 30. Being raised by a single mother (teacher and soon-to-be principal), living in a house with a really loving and caring family (grandma, grandpa, uncle). Now that we've got formalities out of the way, let's get into the shit.. . I was a token student. A kid everyone knew as ""that one smart kid"" or someone with unlimited career opportunities. My depression actually started 6th grade, which sounds weird but hear me out. After the shit I witnessed with my mom and dad arguing all the time when I was still a kid, I turned my attention to reading magazines and huge books on planes, trains, cars and more to get my mind off of the arguments that made me worry. I figure that's how I became so mature at that young age, and also how I became so smart. However, I was and still am an introvert, I suck at talking to people and I always make things so awkward during conversations. For reasons unknown, I was bullied throughout 6th grade... And it continued until the end of middle school (which was actually my best time in school).. . Come freshman year of high school, I continue to do well, which is fine, and my depression is still there but I wasn't suicidal. Sophomore year is when everything went to shit.. . Now sophomore year I overwhelmed myself with all these honors and AP classes - I was up past midnight doing homework almost daily, which I could manage. What was really shitty though was not the AP classes, but it was in fact Chemistry and Algebra 2. My algebra 2 teacher didn't know how to teach and really shouldn't be a teacher; she did not help me understand anything at all, even in tutoring. My chemistry teacher was a total douchebag and I was too afraid to ask him anything, even in tutoring for the fear of being wrong and the fact that he practically called me stupid in front of the class 3rd quarter.. . Each progress report I got that year was pretty bad. I got yelled at by my mom and I cried and I cried, and prayed to God that things would get better. Things didn't get better at all, and I ditched praying. I felt my family getting farther away from me, like I was a disappointment, something really bad in an Asian family like mine. Because of this, I punched myself in the nose every day to bleed without cutting myself.. . My final grades were really bad. The only classes I failed were Algebra 2 and Chemistry, both with D+'s. To top it off, my chemistry teacher put in a comment on my grade saying ""Great student/credit to class."" I was brutally devastated and I cried hysterically every night. I don't even know if I can go to a university or join the USAF anymore, and if so, might as well end it now.. . Come junior year (now!) and things are a bit better grade wise (even though I get yelled at for having a B+) but there's this thought at the back of my head that nothing matters anymore. Even if I get a good grade now, my future is still dull due to my performance from sophomore year.. . Then I have some other problems. I feel like a fucking loser. My friends don't feel like friends anymore, I was backstabbed by two girls I was friends with (not girlfriend), which just happened recently so I am still pretty fucking down. I feel like a lot of people distance themselves away from me because of how negative and gloomy I am, and I'm just an all around awkward person to be around and to talk to. I guess people look at me as ""that weirdo"".. . I look at couples in hate. I look at people who have awesome 4.0+ GPAs in hate. I look at happy people in hate. I hate successful people... I guess I hate everyone.. . Speaking of couples, one of the girls that backstabbed me went behind my back saying that she wasn't interested in having a boyfriend when she told me she liked me (pretty contradictory, I know) and went to homecoming with one of my friends. I'm no longer friends with her, even though she thinks we still are friends.. . Now I have standards for girls, and I have my eyes set on this really nice Asian girl who sits by me in two classes. Token student, professional, knows what she's doing, fun to talk to despite my awkwardice and nervousness. Knowing my luck, I'll never have her though, and besides, I've never had a girlfriend before.. . In conclusion, I guess this was sort of a rant about my life. I don't even think I made any points clear. All I can say is that all of the problems I stated above are really hitting me now, and I think it's time to end things. I really have no purpose of being here, nor do I think I'll become anything I want to be in the future.. . In the end, it's me against the world, and I'd say the world won.",suicide

"Finally found happinessThe ""light at the end of the tunnel"" phenomenon is real. That light is nothingness, it's oblivion.

Not one of them has ever even tried to help me, they know my issues but they would never even go out of their way to invite me to do anything with them or introduce me to someone.

"I've thought about killing myself every moment for the past week.I have a lot on my mind but I'll try not to ramble. Last week was my 20th birthday. I got really drunk with some friends and for some reason (I don't remember why) I got really upset and had a meltdown, walking around town at 7:00 AM not knowing how to think about my life other than the fact that I hate everything about myself. When I got home I cut myself with a way too dull knife and went to bed. Since that night the thought of committing suicide has made me feel so low I can barely function. I've missed classes, a group project, and now I don't even think I could go to my finals next week. I don't think I want to die but I know I don't want to go on living. At least not this life. I'm also really tempted to get all my shit together and just run away and try to start over but I don't think I could manage that. I'd be happy to just fall off the face of the world forever...",suicide
"Running out of hope for the futureHello all, as I'm writing this I currently have a crypto-currency trade open, as soon as it auto finalizes I will be sending the funds to a different wallet so I that I can purchase a fatal dose of fentanyl. My girlfriend of 2 years left me a few months ago and I have been staying at my parents house ever since. I have a long and very shitty relationship with my mom for years now (25M) .My mom is a narcissistic bitch whom kicked me out of the house as an adolescent for wanting to have friends and for wanting to go out and be a kid, when I was about 5 years old my mom left my father and re-married. My whole life I have literally been the family punching bag, they used to make me do all of the household chores and they would never split the work up between my brothers, fast forward to a few years and to this day these kids (my half brothers, stepdads kids) have never picked up a fucking sponge. Instead my parents have a maid that comes and cleans the house but still if there is anything that needs to be done like the dishes or etc I'm the fkn dish bitch that they call to come clean up the mess. . . &amp;#x200B;. . When I was about 14 years old I remember one summer they woke me up and sent me outside to go into the backyard to clean up the pool, I was out there all day in the heat and they wouldn't let me come inside until it was done, my step dads stupid ass forgot to put the cover on the pool so for months it had been rained in, leaves had fallen in, mosquito larvae out the ass and there were even a few snakes. They gave me a rake and had me rake up all of the wet, nasty, mosquito infested leaves and then bag them up into yard bags. It took me the whole day. . . &amp;#x200B;. . Now really that story wouldn't be a big deal if my parents didn't have so many fucking kids!!!! Still to this day these kids are spoiled! They have everything they need and they've never had to do so much as to pick up a fkn sponge or load the dishwasher. . . &amp;#x200B;. . My step dads kids will never know what its like to be kicked out on the street, they will never know what its like to not have a loving father figure, they will never know the pain of being mistreated because you're mother remarried and ""these bad ass kids arent mine"" . . &amp;#x200B;. . Out with the old in with the new am I right?. . &amp;#x200B;. . I have 1 full blood brother who has the same mom and father as me but unfortunately he passed away 2 years ago at the ripe age of 19 years old. My mom kicked him out at 18 years old, he didnt even last 2 years on his own. . . &amp;#x200B;. . My mom told me to kill myself already just the other day. I will be sure to let everyone know why I turned out the way I did",suicide
"I feel shity because the way i feelI am a 23 year old that do not have problems with my parents, but i dont have motivation for nothing and I get sad for nothing, and that makes me angry, Im uncapable of fall in love with anybody since my first love that i dumped because im so sacared of feel emotions.. . In 2011 my grandmother died and i feel so guilt since that, and i know that is not my fault, but i keep get this image of her in the coffin, and i just cant control. . Years after she died i thought this sadness was normal, and in 2015 i planned to kill myself, and i couldn't because i though in everyone in my life and i was so drunk that i blacked out. After that i had a relation with the only girl i ever loved and that ended in less than a month because of my mentals issues. . After that i knew i need help and start to medicate myself with a professional, and im better now, im working doing all my things at university, but i dont know why, because i still not feeling pleasure in nothing, still an alcoholic and drug user, uncapable of having a emotional relationship, still have suicidal thoughts and all that with perfect friends, family and a confortable economic situation. . .

"Now I've ordered the thingsI've ordered the things I need to carry out my suicide plans – so it's only a matter of time. Can't stand the meaninglessness and loneliness anymore.. . I suffer from some kind of cyclical depression so I've been this path a few times before but this time it's different.. . My life is pretty sweet. I'm healthy, career on a good path, I'm in a city that I like and I have hobbies to fill up my time. But it's all so meaningless. It gives me nothing. I feel so empty. So: it's another cycle of depression.. . I've been to the mental emergency room a few times the last months and I'm now on semi-regular meetings with a psychologist and will problably start taking medicine again. However, there is no pill against lonelines and my social situation.. . No one wants to spend time with me. Oh, I can make a few calls or send out a few texts and I'll have a coffee-date lined up in the coming week – but it's been years since someone reached out to me just to hang out.. . During this depressive cycle I've had amazing friends that has taken their time to meet up with me, stay at my place and listen to me if I ask them. A few even texts me every now and then to check in on me. Though they just make sure that I am not dead – they never want to actually spend time with me. (However, I guess it's better than those who straight up avoid me after I've opened up to them). . I understand that people get more and more busy now as we grow older. That means it will only go more down-hill from here on out. I've passed the best time of my life.. . I have a girlfriend (we don't live together). It's not a fully perfect relationship but I love her more than anything and I've never felt this close to someone. However, her interest in me has faded. She almost never asks me what I'm up to or what my plans are. She never asks any follow-up questions or seem interested in me or what I do. I don't feel like a fully fledged person in her eyes anymore. Maybe I should break up with her – but then I will end something that could be good again – and I'll be 100% alone.. . With all of this, I don't have any hope for a brigther future and now have a full plan this coming week. I'll finish up the last few letters and administrative preparations while waiting for the things to arrive.. . To the person who showed enough interest to read all of this; there is no point in reaching out or responding. I've had countless talks with friends in person and talked with multiple professionals – all with no improvement. There is no realistic change an internet person could do at this point.

"DoneLife is too hard. Living is just too hard to keep going.  And after 32 years of pain and suffering, I feel like it’s time to just end it..  . I really wish someone could convince me that life is worth living, but its not really possible to convince me, because life is just not.  . . Let’s call it like it is. Let’s call a spade a spade. I’m an ugly, worthless, fat ass piece of shit loser.. . I’m not worth dating. My ex wouldn’t even put in the effort to hang out with me and started dating someone before we even broke up. I continue to let myself be manipulated by him, and waiting for him to pay me back the $3k he owes me, making me keep in contact with him while I see him dating other people. Killing myself will end that debt and end me having to see my money go to him spending it on dates. . . Before that my only relationship of 10 years really consisted of someone who was sexually aggressive, would constantly pressure me to have sex, and while we broke up, he still manipulated me so I wouldn’t date other people.  Now he’s happy and successful and I’m shit. . . I’m just so fucking ugly and fat that no one else would want to date me, or people go on one fucking date with me and ghost me, because I’m so much of a loser. Every gay dating app there is, reminds me that no one wants me. I’m a fucking piece of ugly shit.. . The thing is I don’t want to do anything. I’m a lazy piece of shit and don’t really care to lose weight. I’d rather just end it. It’s too much work to go to the gym and try to lose weight.  It’s too much work to change my eating habits. I’d rather just die already.   . . I’m in so much debt and bad with credit cards. I have no desire to learn how to pay them back. So much so I know I will never be able to get a house or other big loans.. . I hate my job right now, and have never really enjoyed any work that I do.  My coworkers don’t do fucking shit, and are fucking lazy as well, and I’m having to take on their work because I’m more efficient than they are. I don’t want to work. I just wanna lie in bed til I die to be honest. . . I’m honestly just tired of hearing that things will get better, because that’s a fucking lie. 32 years of living on this earth have proved to me that things don’t get better. Yes, there may be moments of happiness, but those are few and far between for me.  And honestly, they are not worth the pain I have to deal with every. Single. Fucking. Day.  Pain of having to be alive, while just constantly thinking about killing myself.  I have physical pain and stress on my body. . . Now really is the best time. My family is in another state, and have two other great sons. I have a couple friends, but they are happily coupled and deservedly so, they plan on moving on, and we are drifting apart. So really the fewest people in my life would be affected. While I’m sorry to those that are, I feel like this is what is best for me. . . I’ve tried to be happy, and it just doesn’t work. I am taking medications, talking to therapists. It hasn’t helped. Or maybe at one point in my life it did, but now I see the truth that my life is fucking shit. . . I am hoping to kill myself this weekend, or at the very least take some steps to put this plan in motion. ",suicide

"I have got a serious problem ( and i need help )So to explain this story i'll have to go back to the day i was born so my name is N ( for reason of privacy i can't use my real name ) i'm a boy ;my mom is french and my dad is Arabic. When i was 4 years old my dad couldn't stop hitting my mom when he was drunk so one day my mom decided to go away with me so after this she was divorced from him so during weekends i'm going at his home and during the week i'm going at my mom house ( classic when your parents are being divorced ) but one day has came the holidays so i went at my dad house during one week so like every house i had neighbors they had kids and i was playing with them they where my friends but there was on friend in particularly ; I was playing with him on his Xbox 360 every day he had a little brother and his parents was fighting every day because his mom was kinda crazy and she had problems with alcohol too ( i'm telling you this because it's details that will be important later in this story ) everything was normal or almost and then one day his little brother and my friend where together my friend was playing Battlefield 2 or 3 and me and his little brother where on his bed i don't know why but i have kissed him and then we where in love together i have even tried to do sex with him just to remember i was 7 years old and he was 5 years old .I know it sound crazy but it's true but i decided it was enough. It was a rainy day we where around 7 pm i was playing a race game on the Xbox 360 with his little brother we where alone just the two of us ,in my head this idea of ""it's enough"" was turning around again and again i had to tell him to break so i told him to come closer to me and then i just slapped him to the face and i went away from this house as fast as possible so that was the beginning of my story. So to resume all of this yes ,i'm gay and since this story every day i couldn't stop thinking of this .Today i'm 13 years old and i have a girlfriend but there's a problem i am still gay and i really don't want to be but still, i'm watching gay porn ,i love boys of my school .I don't wanna be like this i'm thinking of it every days every hours every minutes every little fucking seconds of my fucking life i wanna kill them all i'm becoming crazy every seconds need advices i'm begging you before i do something wrong.",suicide
"At the bottom of my holeI fucked up. I am a very anxious person, meeting new people makes me almost throw up, when I have to talk to the cashier all I am thinking is the exact words I am going to say. I am just so good in hiding it among friends and family, when they are around it gives me confidence. . . This anxiety has gotten me to the point that my family thinks that I am working, while in reality I have been too anxious and have been postponing applying. I am at the end of my savings and some debt has started to pile up, I have a girlfriend who I have lied to about the job as well. We found a place to rent for the both of us but I am not even in the position to take on rent, let alone pay for the furnishing. I have let her and my family down with my lies and miserable depression. It is funny, because unlike a lot of people posting here, I do fucking love life, there is a lot of amazing stuff I have enjoyed, just the human interaction is what I struggled with. I enjoyed traveling, playing games with online friends and especially nature. I ended up studying for something I didn't enjoy and never took the responsibility in my life to get it on track. . . I feel like I have been digging a hole, and now I am in too deep to escape. I have let my girlfriend and family down and I hope they can move on soon after I am gone.

"I have cancer and my life is constantly getting worseHi everyone, I just discovered this subreddit seeking for help, here's my story. When I was fifteen years old, I tore my groin playing basketball. About eight months later I was having constant pain throughout my whole left thigh after my games, to the point of bringing me tears. So my family decided that we'd go and get another MRI, except this time we found a malignant tumor spanning from the top of my pelvis to about halfway down my femur. This tumor was so large that it was coming up and hitting my sciatic nerve which was causing my terrible pain. The very first thing after this was obviously to have a whole body MRI, where we found that I also had eighteen cancerous nodules throughout my lungs. After my biopsy I was told that I had a very, very rare form of cancer; mesenchymal chondrosarcoma. Only one hundred cases of this disease are diagnosed per year, and they were unsure of how to treat me, and gave me five months to live. I am a very strong-willed, stable, rational, and science-based thinker. The appointment I was diagnosed I told my physician that if removing my whole left leg is what meant keeping me alive, it's what I would do. So time goes on, I am given eight months of treatment including the most harsh form of chemotherapy and radiation, on top of lung surgeries. At this time, me and a girl had mutually fallen in love, we were both with each other almost every day, as I invested all my time into her knowing that any day could be my last day. She was my first love. Time goes on as I have a lung tube and my first lung surgery removing the bottom half of my left lung and taking three tumors with it. I was then told by this girl that she had met someone while on a cruise ship who went to a school near by, and she no longer cared about me. This destroyed me as I had given what I thought was my last bit of love to the wrong person the whole time, I couldn't even fathom what had happened and thought she'd come back. I'd try getting to her, but to no luck I'd get nothing. I was left in a hospital rotting away by myself, as my skin was due to radiation. I sort of got over it. Come to the end of my treatments, I found out I was only left with eight tumors in my lungs which we thought were dormant and we had found that my hip tumor had been killed. I was waiting to go back to school with all my friends, not to mention all the support from all the people from around my city. I had gotten to meet so many people as I was a very social person which helped a lot. After this my parents had told me that they were getting divorced and my mom was soon moved out, to a job where she still to this day lives pay-check to pay-check. My dad then tells me that I am moving away to another city forty minutes away to move in with his new girlfriend. He knew that I had so longed to go back to school with all of my peers, but this didn't matter apparently. I had considered moving in with my mom to stay close to everyone, but my medical bills which exceeded $400,000 would financially ruin her. So I stayed with my dad who promised to get me a car. Four months go by, and after more screenings I discover I now have twelve tumors, and might have to have a hip replacement that will end my basketball and put me in a wheelchair by the time I'm forty, five. I'm not even expected to live past forty five as the recurrence rate for my cancer is 90% on tops of a 10% chance of survival. Mad is in the military and my now step-mom is a trauma nurse in an ICU so my life is very strict and in-line. I constantly get yelled at for things other parents would not raise a finger at. I am at a new school as a senior  with no friends. I have no way of seeing my friends except when I go to my mom's who only gets to see me every other weekend, and when I'm over I want to see my friends, meaning I hardly even see my struggling mom. My thick, long hair has grown back very thin and with a receding hairline. I have no car, meaning I can't see my family or friends when I want. I have no confidence talking to girls due to my hair and that I feel as if I'm a broken version of my old self, and having a car doesn't help. I am grounded and yelled at all the time, I have had my phone and Xbox taken for three weeks right now for ""working out when I was supposed to be in bed"" and the only way I have contact to my friends is over my laptop, which isn't very reliant. I have no money, because I can't drive to get a job and my dad gives me none. I got behind on my schoolwork, my grades dropped, along with my GPA. I wasn't given time to study for my ACT and SAT which I just took in a hurry to meet college deadlines if I even get lucky enough to get in. My sole purpose in life in my opinion is to help people, I want to spread my word, impact and save lives, and use what I have for good. But my depression and suicidal thoughts are holding me back. Why would I stress through eight to twelve years to go through the stressful task of med school if I could die any day now? Do I even have a purpose?  I kept my strong mentality and I became content with the idea of death since I had accepted what I had, knowing it’s what God had planned for me. I was and I still am happy with the fact that I’ve been able to impact other peoples lives with my story and the way in which I have lived by never letting my problems get to me and continuing to be optimistic and disciplined. But now it has almost been three years since my diagnoses, and things in my life have gotten either worse or have been at a constant state of being in mental and physical pain. I wake up and breathe and my lungs ache, I walk downstairs to get ready for whatever I’m doing that day and I can feel my femur scrape against the inside of my hip socket, and I look in the mirror in the bathroom to get ready and look at my hair and am reminded that I’ll never look the same as I used to. All this combined makes me feel like a shell and a broken version of the person I used to be. I can’t even build the confidence to talk to girls because I’m constantly worried about how I look, or that I don’t feel as if I’m good enough for them, or that I’d be a waste of their time since I could literally die at any given time, and I can’t stand this because I have all of this love and no one to give it to, I wish I had someone to take the weight I have off of my shoulders and someone to treat right and talk to. This all adds to my school stress, my mom not living a quality life, and my dad treating me like I’m ten. I have to admit that this positive and optimistic mind that I have is not mixing well with the idea that I’m comfortable and accepting of death. These past couple of weeks my constant pain, depression, and lack of confidence have made me question if anything will ever get better, because nothing has. I’ve started thinking more about death, even to the point of having calm dreams about it, and I’m scared.. . . . If anyone would like to reach out to me or talk, please feel free to.

"My mind is a mess.Greetings,. . To those reading this I'd just like to say thank you for taking the time. . . I can't talk to anyone in my life about my thoughts and daily struggles within myself. So, I figured I'd come to the internet to at least share the dark and lonely path I've walked down. . . I've been contemplating suicide for about 5 years.  It's been so long because I would always grasp some shred of hope to hold onto. Well, things have changed and I've now begun planning my death. In doing so I almost feel more calm, I can sleep a tad better lately. Knowing that in just a short time I won't have to feel anything, ever again.. . Some back story on how I've come to this decision. Ever since middle school I've had very severe shifts in my mindset. I'd go from being ok and laughing to not talking to friends for days, even weeks. Not laughing, or crying, or anything. I'd make bad choices just because I didn't care what the outcome was. I didn't care about anything or anyone. In middle school it wasn't as serious since there isn't really any ""bad outcomes"". These shifts in my mind would result in me being grounded at worst. During high school these shifts resulted in failing classes, family speaking to me about my ""hormonal mood swings"", losing friends or girlfriends, and other miniscule consequences (besides bad grades). Adulthood is when these shifts started to seriously affect me. I'll list these without too much detail.. . Lots of debt, moving from couch to couch, losing many friends, not speaking to anyone for months at a time, not showering, not eating, bad hygiene which resulted in decaying teeth. Tooth decay leaves me with pain 24/7, losing multiple apartments and jobs, self harm, chain smoking, severe anxiety. . . Those are some of the consequences. At least the ones that are easy to understand. . . The reason I've finally decided to go through with this happened in the last few weeks. I had a nice apartment, car, decent job, high end PC, etcc...it's the glimpse of hope I talked about earlier. For reasons that I don't fully understand I had this massive anxiety attack while driving to work. I stopped on the side of the road, smoked a few cigs, and to combat the anxiety I went into that mindset. The mindset of just not feeling anything. I never got to work. I quit my job. I don't know why I quit it. I just did. The day after I quit my job the reality of what I just did sunk in and yet again I went into anxiety and fear mode. Yet again, I just decided to feel nothing. I'm now 2 days away from losing my apartment and my car and starting from square one again. . . I know there are many individuals who have much worse lives than myself. But for mine, I'm just tired. Tired of being my own worst enemy. Tired of letting everyone down. Tired of trying to care. Tired of fake laughing and smiling. Tired of pain both physically and mentally. Tired of being tired. I just want to rest. . . I have tried to get help via hotlines, family, doctors, and friends. Nothing ever helps. No, I'm not religious and never will be. . . I wanted to have somewhere where I could just give a brief glimpse into my mind. . . Thanks for reading.",suicide

However, essentially what happens, is that I’ll text her on Snapchat asking for help, she’ll respond, I’ll try and talk about something else, and if I’m lucky she’ll respond. Anything after that has me left on delivered. I’ll text again a couple days-a week later, half because I need help and half because I want to talk to her. Once, she’s texted me first asking for help, but nothing more really came of that. Side note but I hate being left on delivered since I can’t tell if they’re deliberately ignoring me or if they’re just bad at opening stuff.

"So... Thinking about it. Again....Arguments with my wife have occasionally made me feel like this. It's my 2nd wife. Cheated on the 1st, got 2 boys with her (9 and 11 - crazy names, might change them next year...) . Current wife is REALLY struggling with how she sees their behaviour (on the occasional times she's around them - due to her work, and when we have them here) they're generally not naughty kids, they're just... Kids... And sometimes they fuck up. Don't we all. They obviously try and lie to stay out of trouble when they do fuck up, but my wife hates lying.. . So, tonight I was having a stern word with the eldest after he lied about peeing on the toilet seat. He was stood there, started to wobble and sway, then literally went rigid and started to fall. Luckily I caught him. After I got him safely onto the floor he was hyperventilating. Was very scared and confused as to what happened. Wife is saying he's being a drama queen and putting it on and I fell for it. I think he got himself so wound up and anxious and had some kind of blackout. Wife calls bullshit, and now we're not talking. The passion (from her side) left a long time ago, and now she despises my kids' behaviour. And me.. . He's fine now, back at his mom's.. . I currently help look after stepdaughter who has quite some disabilities and complex needs. . . But right now I'm real close to saying fuck it all. To everything.. .

"Well here I am againCurled up knees to chest in a bathtub of lukewarm water, crying my eyes out. I can feel my stomach caving in and out. Mostly over my ex who left me a year ago and has happily been with someone else ever since. And everyday I miss him and wish I could go back. He was perfect, he made my life worthwhile, and I wasn’t enough, no matter how hard I tried. Now he’s gone. He’s not coming back.. . For a while I was okay, after trying 4 medications I was having some success with Cymbalta, but the side effects became too much for me and I tampered myself off. And now I’m back to waiting to die. It’s good to know that medication was just an illusion, and I’ve realistically made zero progress in moving forward. . No friends who care, no money at all, a shit part time job, parents who have admitted I’m a burden to them. An ugly failure, waste of a life. The only reason I haven’t killed myself is because I don’t want anything to happen to my pet if I go, I love her too much.",suicide

"What will probably happen after you die...Is you'll be sent to hell (aka similar life, but harder) where you will go through a bootcamp and get your ass peeled until you can't take it anymore. . . After you die, you'll be back into this same life you're in right now, but this time your desire to live will have increased, the same way a starving man enjoys poor food dozen times more than before, and will complete this life.. . Once this life is finished, you'll be rewarded with a life you desire. Soul economics, but the currency is experience and challenges overcome. You may be reborn into any timeline, any body, do whatever you wish. . . Don't believe me and going to use 'scientific evidence' to deny this? Well, you know better than me that dead men speak no tales, so no evidence can ever be collected. If you believe in eternal darkness and 'luck' that gave dead things the ability to comprehend themselves, why does this sound more ridiculous to you?",suicide

"The worst thing I ever did in this past year happened yesterday The worst thing I did in this past year was far from ugly. It was something that no man should ever experience, I wouldn’t even wish this to my worst enemy, yet, I had no choice but to experience it yesterday. . . It all started as a normal Wednesday, well, not really, I was in online class in a different country. I took all my classes and prepared myself to what I thought would be a standard flight to the US. Normally, I would take a direct flight from point A to point B, but this this, it was a connection flight. Not that big a deal, but since I am as one would say, quite tall, airplanes are extremely uncomfortable for me, and I have a harsh time trying to sleep. It was, without a doubt, one of the worst flight in my life. . . That thing to which no man deserves to live through was about to happen, but I didn’t know yet. After 9 hours in the air and with no sleep, I was having an excruciating amount of pain in my legs, but suddenly, right as I began to feel the first part of a long process, my life flashed before my eyes, as if an anti-mask protester went through the door of a store and stood right beside me while screaming at me and the store clergy for wearing our masks. It took me no more than 10 seconds to realize what was happening and what I had to do. It was like an admiring man once said, “the hardest choices require the stronger wills”. And so I promptly rushed to the restroom, for I had to take a shit. . . Yes, you read that correctly, I had to take a shit on an airplane after 9 hours of flight. But the worst was yet to come.. . While opening the door of the lavatory, the gates were no longer able to successfully keep the shit inside. Much like Republicans in the US Capitol, my shit was quickly trying to break through. Once I placed the toilet paper as to not have to touch the toilet seat with my bare ass and sit down, the gates burst open and the bathroom exploded with the shit that I had created. But the recurring thought of, “what if” kept taunting me throughout the process. . . “What if there is turbulence?” I asked myself. I tried to clean house as fast as I could, and when I was about to finally empty it, a huge turbulence hit the plane. “Shit!”, I shouted quite ironically. I heard the seatbelt sign turn on, and I started to fear for my life. I didn’t know what to do. There was shit flying around the lavatory, but I pulled myself together, and with my experience of wiping my ass thousands of times, I began to clean the gates.. . It wasn’t after many fail trials that I quickly realize that there was still a little bit left inside, but even though it wasn’t as big as the others, it came out outta nowhere with a Big Bang, and so the Spanish Inquisition promptly exited from my ass unexpectedly, and proceeded to end my nightmare once and for all. And they did, quite literally, since I woke up from my sleep back at my house. . . TL;DR: Took a connection flight, 9 hours through the flight I had to do the unimaginable. I had to take a shit. The worst things happened. However, it ended in a quite unexpected way. [Read the last 2 paragraphs]. . Anyway, thanks for making my first year of Reddit fun and enjoyable, 2020 was a year full of horrible events, but also hilarious memes and incredible videos.

"I need help to keep goingIt's currently 3am where I live, and I'm just sitting here in my best friend's couch while she's alseep, and I don't know what I'm doing with my life anymore. . I'm currently on a waiting list for being hospitalised in a mental health clinic. It's been three weeks, and I'm getting at the end of my rope. And I've planned this hospitalisation, because I do wanna get better, I really do. But it's getting so hard not to do anything stupid. My mind keeps sending me suicidal thoughts on how I should permanently numb myself with xanax (which is my prescribed medicine). I'm really trying, but I feel that I'm becoming less of myself everyday, I can't even take proper care of myself anymore, or anything really. I know I'm really sick and I need help, but I can't have it right now, so I just have to wait. But everyday the thoughts keep getting stronger and I'm afraid I can't hold on much longer, I don't know what to do. I would like to go out and do stuff to distract myself like go to the movie or stuff but I don't have the money for it and most of the time, not the energy either.. I need distractions, something to help me keep going until I can get medically supervised, but I don't know what. Plus it's getting more and more complicated to feel happiness, or to enjoy things I usually appreciate. I feel absolutely numb. And I know how a suicide attempt goes, I've unsuccessfully tried 5 times before, and I don't want to get to that point again.

"Pretty much tbh. I'm 16, I have no father,no one knows where he is since 5 months ago he was a meth head, and my mother is abusive. I live with my aunt. I spend every day of my life on a computer all day playing games. I have no friends, I'm depressed and have been on and off for years but more on than off, I fantasize suicide almost every day,  I'm so numb I have a constant 1000-yard stare, I tell myself that ""the time machine will come take me back one day so I can fix everything"" so that I can escape the reality that I can never take back what I've done, I break from mental anguish and burst into fits of laughter sometimes having to silence myself so no one hears, I've desensitized myself to practically everything you can imagine, because of my mother I will never have a normal relationship with a girl because I am so verbally abusive and take things too serious, sometimes while I cry I rehearse what I'll say in my suicide video.

"Help is pointless...I have been depressed for a long time, I am not sure when, the hospital diagnosed me with MDD when I ended up there. Now it's been six years, I have not had attempted suicide, I just always considered it, looking down the bridges or the balcony to see if I will survive. It started during grade eleven and hurt me the hardest during summer as I started cutting myself, then during grade 12 I was considering suicide which ended me up in the hospital and then I had to take grade thirteen as I lost too much time and fell behind in classes while I had a social worker and taking prozac actively. None of it was helping I was just dragging on.. . I attended college and changed majors twice, I spent one year in one and failed and another that I spent two years in until I couldn't take it anymore it was not only affecting me mentally, but  it was hurting me physically, my immune system was compromised because of stress. I felt useless, I felt helpless and I must admit I had two counselors and I had been taking my medication regularly. I quit the medication, it wasn't helping me and I was spending most of the time in bed, and quit eating food for days, starving myself for. I came out of the major and took another one that felt better for me I had a very good gpa at first , I did still have counselors but I stopped the medication all together as I said earlier. So I was pretty confident with myself come the second year and I decided that I didn't need counselors anymore so I closed my case with them. Later that year I started struggling again, I was tired I spent sometimes sixteen hours in school just trying to get things done but I failed so many times and at the beginning of third year I gave up and came out of the program.. . My parents after my hospitalization kept saying it was okay that I am not performing well but that's not me. I wanted to perform well at least at one thing in my life, to complete college and probably get a good co-op opportunity but now after six years I am at square one. Constantly thinking of suicide, feeling that I have no path forward, I am done hanging in there. . . All the time I struggled and told my friends, I just lost them as if I had no close friends. I still have my best friend and another close friend but I don't bother telling them how I feel everyday, but they stayed and know my story. Oh I forgot to mention the obvious, I don't have a girlfriend or any relationship, I tried a few times with a few people but I failed and stopped perusing a relationship.. .

"This needs to stopI'll first state that I've been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, depression and Asperger's as it will help anyone understand, if even in the slightest. About last year around September, I've been having these deep feelings of depression and suicide. My family don't support me and my friends try with very little effort to help or listen to what I have to say. It got to the point where, during the entire month of September, I'd be drinking heavily and taking capsule after capsule of THC oil to try and numb my emotions.. . None of that worked as I found out, because when I came out of my high or stupor I'd be back in reality where everything just sucked again. My paranoia got worse probably for obvious reasons, but even before the binging of weed, I felt like my friends and my family and my doctor and therapist had it out for me. I kept asking them and myself, ""Why aren't you helping me? Why are you sitting on your hands watching me break down month after month?""... at first it made me furious because I see people who complain about far less like, how annoying traffic was during the day and they'd get all the sympathy and empathy and cuddles and kisses they'd get and then some.. . I ranted at my friends on how much I hated myself and that I didn't deserve the treatment I was getting with them following up with how I'm playing the victim. Even my therapist told me this as well. I even tried calling a suicide hotline and the ""counselor"" on the other line had to cut our conversation short and said, ""Sorry, but I have to go"" and hung up on me. . . I then lost every fibre in my body to live and decided to overdose on multiple over the counter medications and prescribed medications because my intention was to leave the world and escape this never ending pain. However, my mother whom I live with, called the paramedics ""just in time"" to send me to the hospital. The nurses there, I could hear them talking about me behind my back and how I played the victim or how there were other patients who needed the bed more than me, etc.. Everything I could do to try and kill myself was met again with the reality that this world really does have it out for me.. . I cannot tell whether it's my paranoia anymore even though my psychiatrist and therapist tell me it is. Nothing I can say or do can show how stressed I am, besides trying to OD two or three times over in the span of 4 months. I've been admitted to the psych ward 3 times since, and my patience has already diminished. I cannot continue living in a world where everyone constantly sees me as some kind of devil.. . I have zero support from everyone and my paranoia is getting worse day by day now. I constantly feel that whenever I sleep someone breaks into my apartment and just fucks with me. I feel like I'm being followed and monitored everywhere I go. Everything I do is criticized by the people I used to think I loved, and now with smartphones and shit, I'm feeling like people are recording and taking pictures of me to see how pathetic of a person I am.. . And yet when I desperately try to OD I keep getting saved... saved again and again to be tortured in this mind-fuck of a hell. How many more times must I OD until I'm finally able to be done with my life. Let someone else take my place, I don't give a shit anymore.",suicide

We went about our thing and got to a point where we stopped because we were both too drunk. We ultimately didn't have sex outright, and I checked in with her the next day and she said she had fun. However, later on I heard from a mutual friend that she felt that I was too rough during foreplay and had bit the inside of her thighs (not blood, but she had marks/bruises the next day) while going down on her. She did desire to hook up with me, but felt in retrospect that I was too rough and found it jarring. She didn't tell me while we were together that I was being too rough, but I apparently had assumed she did, even saying it aloud (which is uncharacteristic of me) and I know this to be wrong. I thought I had just been giving her hickies and such and am shocked that I was too rough without asking for explicit consent. . . I've reached out to her to try to talk through this and she's said she'll talk with me soon when she's ready. I haven't been able to think about anything else for a moment since. . . Since I learned of this I've been experiencing a lot of shame/suicidal thoughts for having put someone through a situation which made them distraught. Today has been really bad and a lot of my ideas have been revolving around passive suicide i.e. getting hit by a car, spontaneous death. I keep imaging myself jumping off a fire escape/out of the window at work and just not having to be anymore. I feel so much shame that I'm sick to my stomach 24 hours a day, I can't sleep, and I feel like my life may be over as I can't see myself ever not hating myself now. ",suicide

"My girlfriend just blocked me on all platforms without saying anything. I never her told her what I was going through but now I’m alone.I started dating a long time on and off friend about a week ago online, unfortunately about a hour ago she blocked me on all platforms and I don’t have any way to contact her. I have no idea what to do, I’m okay if she needs to leave cause I don’t want her to be committed to something she’s not interested in - but why does that mean she has to cut me off so hard? Last night when we spoke we talked about animal crossing and then I went to bed and ended the call, there wasn’t any prior hints or anything so this was out of the blue. . . As much as I hate to admit it but two months prior I had ended a relationship of 2 years due to them cheating on me when we became long distance(her sister let me know, I still appreciate that). But sometimes I wonder if I should’ve just stayed with her even if most the time I was depressed as fuck and had to go through being the blame for so many issues -  atleast then I can feel something. . . Ignoring all of this I recently moved to a new state after being alone for most of quarantine. I’ve been trying to make friends and the best I’ve been able to do is have sort of good conversations with coworkers though I’ve heard them talk about me and how they think I have some mental issues due to how I speak(I’m soft spoken). . . This all being the case it may be due to this having recently past the date of a very close friend who passed away when I was much younger. He was so much more talented, smarter, charismatic, and kind. Every day for the past 10 years I’ve known the world would have been better now if I was the one that took the blow from the car. I could t save him then and I can’t save myself now. . . My home life or lack there of one is blank. My work life is a joke. I almost had a relationship. I haven’t told anyone but I’ve been holding on by a thread for the past month and trying so hard to live for my parents but I can’t even find that. I’m unbelievably selfish for saying that.

"I Wish My Family Hated MeThey're pretty much the only reason why I am alive right now, even though I wake up and wish I were dead every day.

Even when I'm genuinely happy I think about how I wouldn't really run or fight for my life if someone tried to murder me.. . I think life is pointless. I'll agree with people saying that we do have an impact on the world, no matter how small, but does that really matter in the grand scheme of things? Eventually the earth and our entire solar system will come to an end, and I know some of you will say something along the lines of ""well it doesn't matter if it will end, we are thrown in here against our will and it's better to do something useful with our time here than to just mope around until death,"" but you know what? Fuck that. I don't care if I'm being unreasonable or if there is a way to resolve my unhappiness, I don't want it. I just don't like living. I hate the cycle, the human limitations, the fact that I need to do shit like have a bunch of friends, exercise, eat balanced meals to be able to be happy.. .

"The world is too scary to live inI'm so tired of hearing about all of the bad things happening in the world. Nothing bad has ever happened to me or anyone I know, that I know of anyway. But hearing so often online or on the news about harassment, assault, murder, and all the other bad things in the world is making me incredibly anxious. I was never scared to go outside or be alone or anything, but hearing so many bad things is making me scared where I didn't used to be. On top of this hearing people saying things online like every single female in the world has experienced assault from a young age, or gets harassed regularly, or is terrified to go outside, is making me terrified myself (I'm female.) Like I said, I was never scared of anything like this and nothing remotely bad has ever happened to me (and it's not like I never go outside, I take public transport every day and some of those days alone.) But now after seeing stuff like this on the internet I'm just so anxious of being alive.. . . I'm going to have to go out to university soon too, and now I'm terrified to. I really feel like dying is the only solution to avoiding all the horrible things that can happen to you in the world we live in. What is the point in continuing living in a place where you can feel such horrible pain and suffering, when you could guarantee you don't have to experience any of it by just taking your own life? I'm way too scared to die at the moment but also worried that I'll gather the courage to. Honestly I've had thoughts about suicide for as long as I can remember, and as I grow older I find more and more reasons to do it. I know that there's no way I will right now for a few reasons (I'm scared and have people I wouldn't want to hurt), but in the future I can't be so certain.

I will continue going to school for another ~12 years, getting a job as a doctor, but I will be in my 30s at that point.. . . . 2. I don't graduate early. I take random classes for the year, maybe study abroad; live in apartment away from my family..

"Agressive SuicideOr Hostile Suicide. . Or whatever it’s called.... I have a confession to make. The short version of it, it’s that I have suicida thoughts because of my break up. . The longer version is : My bf told me he wants an open relationship, and I understood it is either this or we break up. I cannot live with neither of those. I « accepted » for now, to gain sometime, maybe hoping for a miracle. But I am suffering like hell, crying everyday, having nightmares. I am absolutely not interested in other man. He doesn’t know HOW bad I feel, I cannot tell him that because Then he would only feel pity and it would be another kind of agony, he would want me even less. Yes I know this is « abusive » of him or whatever. Also Clearly I have deeper issues if a break up makes me suicidal. . But it is what it is. If we break up, I just know I cannot handle the pain. . Now here is my darkest secret, which I wonder how many of you share :. . At first the suicide thoughts were only a relief because, with suicide, this horrible pain ends.. I even felt sorry for him, thinking about how this will impact him. (He is NOT a horrible person. He  was crying when he told me how he felt because he knew at some level this would destroy me.. he just doesn’t love me/doesn’t love me in a monogamous way. He is worried about me, probably staying with me for pity although he says he still loves me. He is being sweet ... because he knows I am a mess. But there is NO negotiating the open relationship thing. He has no moral obligation of staying with me if he is unhappy - right??). . Now here comes the dark : Part of me still hates him... and wants him to suffer. And now my suicide seems to have 2 great reasons :. . - My pain stoping . - His pain and guilt beggining . . Yes I also know that he WILL move on, mauble quicly. He has lots of friends, a loving family, will probably get some therapy after this ... and will soon come to the conclusion that my suicide was NOT his fault. Also he has everything : good looking, funny, smart, rich, great at many (and extreme) sports. So many women will be right there waiting for him.. . And still, here I am, with my pathetic attempt to impact him one more time. To make him cry at least one more time. To traumatize him, by jumping off our window (14th floor) so he can see my smashed out brains. I may leave a suicide note... or not. He will know it was because he stopped loving me.. (We still live together). . Will I actually do it? No idea, it’s 50/50.. If I do, I will make sure I jump when he is coming back from one of his dates. My fantasy is seeing him coming and jumping right in front of him, so He is the first to see me.. . I wonder if other suicidal people have this kind of feeling, this fantasy. How common is this ??",suicide
"why does the thought of suicide feel like an obligation at timesI have been ""plotting"" my suicide seriously on and off for months. Every time I come out of my slump and horrid hole of thoughts, I feel an enormous sense of relief. Yesterday, I drafted my will and strangely that calmed me down. I wasn't scared. Today, I feel better. I just wonder if anyone else feels like when they back off the proverbial cliff, do they feel almost shame, or guilt? Like that suicide pact with yourself is an obligation? I think it is because the torment of thoughts and reason behind them are still there, but manageable. I just wanted to ask you collectively, as a community. I can't ask my husband or mother without terrifying them, as I know it would. I don't want to scare them. Anyway, I hate the lingering emotional aftermath. And the feeling like I am not following through. That sentence sounds haunting; please don't worry. As ironic as that sounds, I am out of my hole for now. I am in counseling. The biggest secret is no one knows I have thought of this, or for how long. I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so. I would never use a weapon from my household. I...I don't think I would do ""it"". I am just tired. I am so fucking delicate and I cannot stand being weak. I know everyone in this world goes through shit- my problems lie in my brain. I feel different than anyone else. Not able to connect- not in a sociopathic way (no offense to sociopaths),  but like I was wired different and a shortage happened in the middle that made me odd or different to anyone.

I have everything I could want, which is nice, and I'm about to be able to drive. but what does all of that matter if I'm never happy, and I wont have anywhere to go. All of my ""friends"" treat me like shit, and are really my brothers friends, and I'm just kinda there.. . you know the meme where some guy says a banger joke, but nobody laughs, so he says it again, and his buddy says ""why'd you just say the same thing twice""? that's every conversation when I'm hanging out with them (my ""friends"").. . the worst part about those 2 texts in 2 months was that one of them, from somebody I really do consider a friend, was them asking me to follow one of her friends on twitch, and when I try to get a conversation going, they go offline. the other text was from someone else saying ""sorry, I forgot my password lol"" and the same thing happened.. . I used to have a bunch of friends, but then my dog cunt of a brother gets them to hate me, and start hanging out with him. . . I am convinced that I cannot get anyone to be friends with me for an extended period of time, and some days I wonder if I should even try to get up. I don't have anywhere to go since I'm doing online school full time, and nobody seems to care about me, not even my parents, they only seem to care about me when I fuck up, or if my grades are fine.. . I cant even express if I'm annoyed at something where I live. if I so much as sigh the wrong way, my parents start saying that I have nothing to be angry or sad about, but sometimes, someone just maybe, oh I don't know, FEELS SAD?!?!. . sometimes I'll get a buzz from my phone in my pocket and I get excited, but then I look and its some bullshit about a new deal on sweat coin, or a bot text from tony hawk, and sometimes maybe an @ everyone on discord.. . so far the only good thing that has happened is I found a relatively cheap gym, and now I'm going there to hopefully get better when it comes to managing my weight, but it seems like I'm destined to be a disgusting fatass.. . thanks for reading this, I just am in a bad spot mentally and I don't want to burden people that I see every day with these thoughts. I'm sorry if I upset you, and I hope I didn't put a bad twist on your day, or make the start of your day sad.",non-suicide

"I think I’m gonna stop doing stuff with friends for my birthday I think after the fifth grade I stopped having birthday parties, and I wasn’t invited to many either, mainly because I moved to a new state and didn’t have many friends, so I just had a nice dinner with my family at a steakhouse or something on my birthday. In eighth grade I found a new friend group and went to their bday and stuff. In ninth grade and I a bday “party” after four years of not doing much for my birthday. We went to Main Event and ate at CPK with my closest friends, but it didn’t really feel that exciting anymore. I think at some point you just grow too old for that sort of stuff. I made this post because my birthday is in exactly two weeks and I’ve decided that all I want to do is cook a nice meaty juicy steak dinner. I love cooking and baking and I’ve never cooked a steak before. I’ve been fascinated by steak videos on YouTube and now I want to make one for myself. I might make a cake as well if I have time but I probably won’t cause school’s a bitch. I feel like this will either be a huge success or huge flop. Either way this is gonna be great. I just hope my friends don’t care too much.. . . TLDR: I don’t want birthday party I just want to cook a nice juicy steak dinner instead of hang out with friend.",non-suicide

"Don’t know if this is the right sub for this but here we go... I’ve been talking to this girl for about two years, we are good friends, and I kinda formed a crush on her, only some of my closet friends knew (other than her) and we all would hang out together. Eventually the news spread and she knew I had a crush on someone and begged me to tell her, she said “you can trust me, I’m a girl maybe I can set you up”, things like that went on for about 5 months and I decided I was going to ask her out to the christmas dance, but I kept getting cold feet, and then two weeks before the dance one of my friends told her about my crush on her, and I couldn’t deny the facts, she already knew the truth, it was kinda awkward for the rest of the day, she kinda didn’t talk to me and would avoid me , at the end of the day my friend that told her about my crush was talking with some of her friends ( we are all kinda close) and apparently she liked me back, but was afraid that if we got together and broke up we wouldn’t be friends anymore, I thought that was respectable, but I still haven’t tried asking her out so the Monday before the dance I did it, “Would you like to go to the dance with me”. She just walked away and didn’t even show up to the dance saying “ she dosen’t like crowds”, I have been depressed even before this, but after she ghosted me, it was an all time low it was like we weren’t even friends anymore, well I had to deal with that for all of Christmas break and when we got back to school it was kinda no different, every time I would try to rekindle the friendship we used to have and confront her, she would say, you are my friend and always will be, but still didn’t really show it, and then one of her friends spilled the beans, turns out she liked one of my other friends more, and one detail I haven’t added was he liked her as well, I was heart broken, I stopped talking to people I stayed inside listening to music and playing video games 24//7 instead of studying for school, I started to feel like I was being resented and hated by my friends and I even thought that she never thought of me as a friend anyway, but my friend ( the one that told her I liked her, not the one that likes her), started comforting me and I got on my feet again, I asked her ( I’m tired of writing her/she, so let’s call her piper), so I asked piper If she liked him, she said yes, I asked my friend ( the one that likes her, lets call him Dan) I asked Dan if he liked her and he said yes, I was so sad but I was like screw It lets get these people together, so I pep talked piper, because originally she was scared of what to say, and I helped Dan ask her out by giving him advice since I know her better than dan, well they did it, started dating ( even to current time), dan was a jerk to me after that since I kinda still liked her, I almost got kicked out of the friend group because “still liking her is wrong” , he almost got kicked because “ you don’t take a friends crush”, well it all finally settled when I got bored of this shit and started looking for a new girl to like, Dan and I are neutral , piper is still dating him, and I’m alone and kinda don’t care, piper and I ended up talking it out and we are ok friends now, Even though I still like her, just by the way she talks, and acts, but nobody will ever know that except the possible billions of people on the internet.. .

"Does anyone else fantasize about living a different lifeI know this sounds weird, but i constantly fantasize about living a different life. I imagine my 2nd life being being attractive, loved by others, having friends, A curvy nice body, Not suffering from depression/anxiety, No self harm scars, Not being awkward, Being rich (or at least financially stable), being young again, Being intelligent, Traveling the world, and being some insta famous privileged white girl with millions of followers.  Instead my life is the complete opposite of that which is why day dream about living that life 24/7, I know it's an unhealthy habit. . . I even thought about killing myself in the hopes I'd get a 2nd life to start over. I know that sounds dumb, but when you're at a point in ur life where u completely give up and are sick to death of living those are the kind of thoughts that run through ur mind. I honestly hope and pray I die soon from natural causes so I can finally be free of this pain. . . No one is going to read this post but I just had to get this off my chest.",suicide

Even basic shit like go to college I couldn't even do that. Everything was so stagnate, if it did change it always changed for the worst. I'm fed up with waking up everyday and dealing with my failures. I asked for help and all people can do is point the finger at me. Well fuck world I know I'm a failure. You don't have to keep telling me over and over again. Every time I see something I want I know it's outside my reach. The stuff I want the most is just impossible to get back. My Dad's been dead so long I can't even remember what he sounds like. I don't even like to think about how my Mom was murdered. It haunts me everyday. . . I'm just done with this world. I hate being here on this planet. I don't like place or the company it keeps. . . I just want it all to end, I have no interest in talking to any therapist or doctor or really anyone all together.

I have a large family with no tragedies which I know is rare, maybe I'm supposed to be that tragedy.

"Help idk what I’m doing So pretty much me and a girl are currently in a sort of “talking stage.” I’m pretty bad at flirting, but I guess I managed to somehow catch her interest??. . We haven’t been friends for that long ( We’ve met before but lost contact for like a year), but shes really nice and pretty good looking. She’s also extremely talented. She’s not exactly the “type” I would see myself going for,, but that’s not really too important to me.. . This stage really started like 2-3 days ago. When it first started I though that I could give it a shot with her. I hadn’t though about being in a relationship with her long enough to really decide if I had a crush on her or not, but I figured I’d just give it a chance and see. I guess I did kind of started developing real feelings for her.. . Now the issue: Today it just kinda feels different. Like idk if I really wanna do this or not?? But I’ve been kind of flirting back and I would feel horrible if I were to tell her that after flirting with her. It’s just all kind of confusing.. . It isn’t really a definite “I’ve lost all and any romantic feelings for her” more of an “I don’t know if I really like her or not???” . . I’m so lost right now,, and honestly this sounds like pretty stupid problem,, so what better to do than post my issues on Reddit for other people to judge.

Here is is. . My heart is just too soft for this evil world. I was never meant to be here. I simply cannot bear it one more day to hear of the suffering in the world... my fellow companions on earth being tortured, abused, raped, murdered. It breaks my heart so much whenever I hear of something sad, I uncontrollably sob for quite a while. How could someone so sensitive be made for this world? My heart simply cannot bear it.

Refrain from hurting others needlessly for your convenience. LOVE OPENLY. Just writing this down makes my heart ache with unbearable sadness, the fact that these horrors actually exist. Please, fill your life with love, happiness, and compassion. If that was common in this world, I'd still be here. Do not let another one go like me. Give that person all the compassion and love in the world. . . It's nobody's fault. I am just not made for this place. Don't cry over me.

"There's no good optionMy first suicide thoughts came around when I was about thirteen years old. I never attempted anything because I'm too scared. Scared for the pain and scared it won't work. . . I've been thinking about options again for some time now. I really want it to work. The best thing I can come up with is going into the woods, climb into a big tree and hang myself there. Falling down a few metres first to break my neck and make it as instant as possible. If that fails though I'll be choking for at least 15 to 20 minutes. There's a risk there. And I'm afraid of heights. Also breaking your neck can't be painless right.. I broke my back a few years ago and it was the worst pain ever. Somehow I survived (wish I didn't) without being paralyzed. It's just a few seconds of huge pain I know that. Or it's slowly dying of suffication.. The best thing about this option is my family won't be the ones to find me. . . I'm sad because there's really no good painless option for people who want to die. All methods are messy and horrible and not always garantueed.  . . Why don't we have the choice when we want to die to freaking die. I WANT TO FUCKING DIE. I'm done with being a slave of society. Fucking shit society with all their preventing shit. Just let us die whenever we want to. HELP us die quick and without pain. Damn. Don't know why I post. I'm just angry about everything. ",suicide

I think im slowly getting readybeen passively suicidal for like 10 or 15 years. I'm almost 30 now. But it used to be like a last resort and a thing i didnt want to do. i used to see signs in life that my time wasnt up and i was still meant for something more. Used to think all the suffering would make me stronger and lead to something. I was such an idiot. This is all life is. I already experienced the best times. And at this point there is less and less keeping me here every day. It becomes more and more a logical choice than an emotional one. The way i talk to my friends now is different. the way i think and act is different. I used to threaten and shit cuz im pathetic and want attention but obviously after years no one cares or listens anymore. Then i used to want to do it just to spite everyone. But these days i find myself not caring at all. I dont think I would even bother telling anyone before I did it. I literally don't care about the attention or getting better anymore. I already quit therapy and medication. I already decided to give up. I already stopped going to school. Ive already had a plan in place for many many years now. I also used to think about giving all my stuff away to my friends and things like that. Now i couldnt care less what happens after i'm gone. It used to seem like some far off dream but now it seems firmly grounded in reality and it's waiting for me right around the next corner.,suicide

The first time he did it, I got really startled, and when I checked discord, the message was gone. So I thought it would be okay to ignore it. Then he kept doing it over a span of a few weeks....and finally, I just confronted him because I just couldn’t take it anymore, I felt nervous, sad, and confused.. .

To top it all off, I think he has anxiety/depression. I’ve had several deep conversations with him, trying to help him feel better because he’s my friend. He has told me that people have thought of him as annoying, and he is often insecure about himself. He also feels that people don’t like him, and he doesn’t have many friends.

"Okay SW, let's see how you handle this one.It took me a while to get this done because I absolutely hate talking about this but something needs to be done.  Haters gonna hate so downvoters do your thing.. . Yes I am thinking about killing myself.  Again.  Let's just get that out of the way.. . Now, for a back story, which involves (predictably) a girl and a few regrets.. . In 2003 I nearly slashed my throat with a knife.  I was a self-injurer back then.  I nearly bled to death, once.  I got it cleaned up though and nobody noticed.  That was the closest I've come to killing myself until a few years later.  This is probably what really set in motion an ongoing cycle of suicidal thoughts -&gt; almost suicide -&gt; hey things got better -&gt; things are okay -&gt; oh god what the FUCK -&gt; suicidal thoughts -&gt; again.. . Over the years I've gone in and out of this cycle several times.  I am currently bouncing between ""oh god wtf"" and suicidal thoughts.. . I'm going to summarize the most recent disaster quickly because I fucking hate having telling this story for the 11 millionth time.. . In 2005 I met a girl - I will call her Susan - we were classmates.  It took me 2 years to work up the courage to ask her out.  She said no, of course, but I was proud of myself for trying.. . We graduated in 2007 and maintained loose contact (her idea, really).. . In 2008 we started talking about things over email.  We shared a few personal things.  Susan was a friend of my own friends so we were already part of the same social circles.  We got close (as much as you might be able to over email).  I guess I must've been doing something right because she invited me along on a trip to another country with several of our friends.  Did you get all that?  Susan, myself, and a few other people were all going on a trip to another continent.  This was her idea.. . So in 2009 we go.  At first Susan is herself but about two days in a switch flipped inside her head and suddenly she turned distant, bitter, short, angry, annoyed, etc etc.  I didn't understand what was going on and it was putting a serious damper on my ""vacation"".  This went on for two weeks.  She had become a completely different person.  My solution for calming down involves removing myself from a bad situation, but in this case, being trapped on the same bus/car/plane/room/hotel/trolley/whateverthefuck meant I couldn't get away from the problem so I eventually had a panic attack for the first time in years.. . We get back, she says she never wants to talk again, we bitch back and forth a few times through email a few times, done.. . Well fuck.  Vacation ruined.. . Oh, I should clarify, we weren't dating.  Heh, we were ""just friends"".  We never touched each other.. . &lt;/story&gt;. . The story above occured in 2009 (it is one of several similar stories).  It's been a year to the day, and I'm am still goddamn mad as hell.  I can't even put into words how fucking pissed I am about this.  I cannot fucking believe that someone would treat me so terribly and then later just walk the fuck away like I wasn't worth the trouble.  Furthermore, Susan has manipulated her schedule such that it's either Susan + friends or me + friends for hangouts.  Not that I would show up if she was there anyway.. . This incident has unleashed a torrent of pent-up anger and regret and hate and bitterness that has been stewing inside me for years.. . When I was a kid, I had a habit of getting the shit beat out of me.  Either at school or at home, someone usually had their first or hand against some part of me in anger.  People told me that they hated me, that I was a burden, that I was stupid, that I should kill myself, that nobody else on this planet would ever love me, or that I was ugly, or weak, or etc etc so on so forth.  I would get things stolen from me, I'd be singled out for ridicule, or wrongly blamed for some crime, or some other shitty thing would happen.  I dealt with it, though, because even when things were absolutely fucking miserable, I would think to myself ""man, when I'm an adult, things won't be so bad, I'll have money and a girl and things will be okay"".. . I guess that feeling died in 2003 but I kept finding ""litle reasons"" to hold on.  Now in 2010, I am 25 years old, I go to the gym three times a week, I make almost 80k/year, I have no debt, and I am in good physical health, so shouldn't my life be working out okay?  I am so bitter and angry about how people have treated me that I just want to just get a shotgun and blow my brains all over the inside of my living room.  I cannot stop living in my past.  I still have nightmares about high school, nightmares about Susan, nightmares about women in general and generally feel like shit, all day everyday.  I am 25 years old and while I see people around me having fun and being happy and moving on with their lives I still stand there and think, wait a minute, what about me?  When does all the fun start for me?  Girls?  Hello?. . When I go out and ""try"" to do something good for myself, I can tell in the way that people look at me, or the way I'm treated, that people just flat out do not like me.  I know this is because of my defensive nature.  I was taught to act that way by those useless asswipes from my early years.  I cannot break that feeling of ""oh god, this guy/girl is about to totally flip the fuck out and I'm going to be in so much trouble"" when I meet new people.. . I'm seeing Susan again at a friend's wedding in about 36 hours.  She emailed me once to say she's ""sorry about what happened last year"" and ""hope you don't have any reservations about seeing [her] at the wedding"".  I am so anxious and pissed and upset I could barf until I turned inside out.  Twice.. . UGH.  Wall of text.  Fuck everything.",suicide
"I don't know what to choose.I am often thinking if I should kill myself or if I should continue to live and hope for something great to happen. I could just jump from a building and all my worries would go away and cease to exist. I donlt find it sad, it is just a way to end my problems. But if I continue to live and hope for something great to happen, it will be SO HARD to endure each day the worries and problems. So difficult... Sometimes, I ask myself how people are surviving, what they are thinking to be happy. I feel I am nothing to society: not accepted socially by a lot of people, though I have friends who accept me and who are considered kind. But by being friends with kind people, I think I am just too fragile. I feel guilty for being fragile and I know I have to toughen up, but I don't know how I can toughen up.

It’s funny, because even though I’ve been debating this on and off for five years, I still haven’t decided on my method.. . A month ago I lost the only person in my life who gave me reason to be a person and everything I’ve done since then makes me feel like a fucking imposter. My life is in fucking shambles now. I skip school because I’m too depressed to get out of bed, I can’t even text people — I’ll try but I can’t get more than a couple texts in without feeling like a sham and just leaving them on read, I’ve started cutting again to try and feel less, I sleep weird ass hours (10 pm-2:30 am), I cant eat, every day I feel worse and worse and I have no fucking clue what to do.. . The only thing that made sense to me anymore is hurting myself because at least then I felt in control.

"I wish people would stop telling me that life is worth living and for once just try to understand how I feelI'm not asking them to encourage me to end it.

"It’s been 7 years.As of yesterday, it’s been 7 years since I was supposed to die. 7 years since I decided I was done, I wanted to die, I was going to kill myself. 7 years since my parents found me unconscious on the bathroom floor. 7 years since I was taken to the hospital, the staff unsure if they could save me. 7 years ago they saved me. And I’m mad. I’m still very very mad. I’m not just mad, I’m angry, I’m guilty, I’m frustrated, I’m confused. And guess what? I’m still suicidal. I’m supposed to be happy that I survived, that I was given a second chance. You see those reports about people who survived jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge. Those survivors say they regretted it on their way down, that they realized death wasn’t the answer, that they still wanted to live. I don’t regret my suicide attempt. My only regret is that I survived, and I don’t think I can count that as regret because that was out of my control. People always tell you that things will get better. Your life will turn around. You won’t feel this way forever. Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. You know what I’ve found? I’ve found that it’s all bullshit. All of it. It’s bullshit. In 7 years I’ve grown a lot, changed a lot, been through a lot. But with all of that, nothing has really changed. I’m still suicidal, every single day. I don’t want to be alive. I feel guilty that I survived and I have no will to live. I have no reason to be around. The world doesn’t need me. It would’ve been better if 7 years ago I was left for dead. Better for me, better for everyone. I’m frustrated that I haven’t gotten any better when people told me that I would. I’ve had breakdown after breakdown for 7 years. I’ve gotten stitches, treated for concussions, been pulled off train tracks. I keep it together while I hallucinate, starve myself, have nightmares, and am just so overwhelmed and afraid. I’m not too bad at hiding it, and for the most part seem like a functional 24 year old. But I’m not. I’m fucked up and I’m crazy and I want nothing more than to be dead. I don’t know what I’m hanging around for. 7 years ago I should have been dead. 7 years later..I still wish I was. ",suicide

Things are going downhill fast - how long before suicidal thoughts turn into anything worse. Do they necessarily turn from thoughts into actions ?. . 2. Given I have no money, no friends to talk to about it - and now no treatment, where to now? Do I just wait until the day comes where thoughts become deeds ?. . 3. My last psychiatrist tells me that Alexithymia is counter productive in group therapy environments, I've seen that backed up on various sites. Is this necessarily true ?. . 4. Given I my alexithymia means that I'm going to end up alone and destitute - is there really any point fighting destiny ?. . Thanks. .

"I've had these flashed of suicidal thoughts since I was 14 and their getting worse. Can I just tell my life story?I think I'll just do this in a chronological greentext style thing.. . Age 6- Built the first of many 'penny shooters' out of cardboard and rubber bands and tape.  Lots of fun.  . . 7-11. . Have all sorts of hobbies... mostly involving building weapons and crap out of sticks and paper and tape and tacks and whatnot.. Also Rubik's cubes, origami, computer programming.  Lots of really obsessive hobbies.  Didn't have any friends though... parent's didn't even care.  ""Friends are overrated"" They said.. . 12- Discover great hobby that I love.  It's dangerous and slightly illegal though.. . 13 and a half or so- Love this hobby more than anything.  Parents put a stop to it... (for good reason.. . 14ish-  Have to take this religious related class in the mornings.  maybe from 12-14 I had the slow and painful realization that I was super socially awkward and had no friends.  Suicidal flashes start.  Just brief images of me killing myself.  I manage.. . 15- start this job working on a farm in another state living with grandparents (grandparents didn't employ me or own the farm though) My dad kind of made me do it.  Made like $9 an hour.  Physical labor... worked 10 hours a day 6 days a week.  Kind of sucked.  I didn't like it.  My dad told it me it was to keep me out of trouble.  bs.  It got me into more trouble then I ever could have gotten into if I had stayed home.  . . 15 and a halfish. Dad tells me that my mom 'discovered' Asperger's Syndrome and that I probably have it.. . tfw I'm a retard. . I research the crap out of it.  Yeah... it matches up really well.  'Special Interests' is just a stupid gay way of putting a positive spin on an unhealthy obsession... like my hobbies.  I figure that's why I'm super sensitive to touch and noise.  I want a diagnosis to confirm.. . Suddenly (like 2 weeks later) my dad says, ""Actually, I don't think you have AS"".  Wtf... ok.  My mom doesn't want me to get a diagnosis because she views it as an unnecessary expense... + she didn't want me on some government record or whatever.. . 16. Work exact same job again for $7.20/hr.  I have no say in the matter.  I hate it.  . . late 16. Summer ends. Quit job.  Basically spend school year jacking off and studying for ACT and GED.  Get high 20s and perfect score respectively...

I work my ass off and get it done.  It was a really stressful time for me.  Suicidal flashes come back... except this time they're more enticing and appealing.  I feel literally no sense of accomplishment when I finish it all... just like there's less pressure.  Whatever.. . 18. Start college (January 2015 actually) in another state living with widowed grandmother..  Pretty stressful.  The thoughts get about 10x worse.  Actually have these breakdowns where I'm just on the floor crying and wanting to scream. . . Had to take these religious classes for some reason.  They were like 'sponsored' or whatever by my church.  I hate the classes.  Everyone is loud and friendly.  They have this stupid annoying ""Hi how are you doing this beautiful day"" attitude.  The teacher is the worst because he is all concerned about me since I'm a loner who doesn't talk to anyone (Still have literally one friend by the way).  It's really annoying.  But the worst part is that the suicidal thoughts go into overdrive during this class... I can barely trust myself to drive back to my grandma's house from that damn class.  . . Today is the last day of Spring Break.  My whole family went to Europe and I stayed behind to house-sit.  I don't care... I'm not jealous, but I've been really lonely and depressed.  I have no friends to do things with.  I haven't done anything all week but chill at the house and screw with this Arduino thing and play Skyrim.

"Anyone else really want to die but don't want to do it themselves. So you just fantasize?I'm just kind of curious if anyone else gets like me at the peak (or valley) of their depression. I just start fantasizing about all the ways I wish I would die, like something out of a great novel or movie. I'm too much of a coward to actually do anything to myself. I held a gun to my head a while back, and choked. Nobody stopped me, I just couldn't pull the trigger. I don't want to be alive anymore though. I just don't. I feel like a zombie. Like I'm alive just for the sake of not being able to die, but I have no real purpose, no real reason to be. I don't even want to go to work anymore, but am also afraid that my co-workers will realize there is something wrong with me if I just stop coming, so I show up and just count the minutes until I can go home. Then I go home, and just sit here, doing nothing, and wondering why I thought this is better than work. . . I fantasize about dying heroically, dying in a really dramatic depressing way, or sometimes even just about getting sick. Some days I can't even eat or drink anything, and just think about what it'd feel like to waste away like I had a terminal illness. It's not like a teenage angst thing though. I don't think about the aftermath, or my funeral, or all the people who'll miss me (even though in reality I have nobody like that, my family fell apart years ago). I just fantasize about things right up until the point of death. It's not even a fade to black. The fantasy just ends because I know it's not a fade to black, it's the end of existence. There is not eternity in the void, as so many people seem to imagine if they're atheists.. . And the worst/best part is how beautiful those deaths are in my head. I know reality doesn't work that way, but in my head I can go gracefully. I usually imagine a conversation too. Even though I don't have any close attachments, I imagine meeting a coworker or something the day before, or while I'm dying, and just going out with some kind of tragic soliloquy, or some kind of clever wordplay that means more to me than them, because they never know I'm dying. . . Sorry, I don't know what the point of this is. I just feel really low right now, and I can't think of anything else to do or worth doing, so I thought I'd just post to see what people think. . .

"Instagrams Pedophilia Problem. So I recently stumbled across numerous accounts on instagram that claim to be young girls (usually 14 to 16) selling their own nudes and photos to older men using cash app and amazon gift cards. I was scrolling through my explore page about a week ago when I started to notice these random shoutout pages amongst the hundreds of memes, or tiktoks that I was watching on the daily. They typically promoted girls and other tiktokers that were around my age (17) while also occasionally posting younger girls that looked to be about 12. It wasn’t until 3 days ago that I would stumbled across one of the most disturbing accounts that I have ever seen. It was another shoutout page...except they were posting images of teens as young as 14 in their bras, underwear, and even censored photos of them completely naked with captions that promoted the selling of their nude photos. I clicked on many of the accounts the page promoted in hopes that reporting them would help even a little bit. Every time I did, instagram claimed there had been no violation of its TOS. Even the page that had the censored NUDE PHOTOS OF PRETEENS was not taken down or seriously reviewed. The accounts of the girls selling their explicit photos followed hundreds of other accounts doing the same thing. They had bios that stated they were selling their bodies for cash and would even post preview photos of them in bikinis showing their butt or breasts. It’s absolutely inexcusable that instagram has yet to crackdown on these Child Pornography rings and it’s absolutely devastating that I and many others can barely do anything about this.",non-suicide

"I just wrote my suicide letter.I’ve been depressed fo most of my life. As an adult, I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I’ve done a lot of fucked up shit on my compulsive states, I’ve been a bother to all the people around me because of how emotionally dependent I am. I’ve forced my friends and family through so much. Still I wanted to believe I’m strong for living through all the trauma and still managing to get a job, to take care of others, to still be an opinionated woman who stands for what she believes.. The past few days I’ve been extremely depressed. And my insecurities and fear of abandonment have been over the roof. Yesterday, I told my boyfriend that. He wasn’t in a good mood (he’s Bipolar) and was a little harsh. I got too worked up and said it was hurtful and that I helped him through his episodes, I just deserved the same. He said he couldn’t deal, that he fell in love with a strong woman and that’s not what he’s got, that I suddenly turned soft and he can’t take care of me. He said some other terrible things, like I want a codependent relationship. It sounded a lot like he had been triggered and was not being himself, but he broke up with me. This person who said he loved me so much, just broke up with me. Now I’m a mess and firmly believe I’m just a weak piece of shit my family and friends would me better off without. .

"Living for nothingI’ve dealt with depression for almost 10 years now. Never really fitting in wherever I lived. I was the only black kid in many of my classes growing up and always heard remarks about my race or was treated as an outsider. When I got to college it became much worse. I went to school out of state in a very dreary climate and didn’t do well in school my first few years despite always being an A and B student my whole life prior. I took many different antidepressants, went to therapy, was even hospitalized for the sedation of antidepressanrs and anxiety medication but nothing helped. I was barely making any money to pay my bills, heavily relying on my parents who were also struggling financially, so in an attempt to get my mind right and ease the burden I was putting on my family, I came back home for a semester, which turned into a whole year back home. My health increased, my depression subsided, I finally had a sense of self. I was ready to finally take a step forward in my life. Until everything came crashing back down on me when my mother, the closest person to me, my everything, was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and died 3 months later. She never smoked in her life. Her death threw me back into the rabbit hole of depression. Not having any emotional support, feeling alone again, questioning what good there really was in the world. During this time I was also dating a girl who despite us being each others “first loves” she would constantly physically fight me whenever she would get drunk or use cocaine behind my back. Time after time she would punch me more times than I could count, breaking her nails off on my face, breaking my glasses on my face, punching me while I was driving, threatening to jump out of my moving car and punching me in the eye so hard while I was trying to walk away that I lost vision in one eye for the night and still do not see the same in that eye a year later. I never hit her back, never got aggressive with her physically and unfortunately never reported her to the police, even when I was questioned when police came out to my neighborhood asking me to tell what really happened and why my face was bleeding and bruised. The last time resulted in her punching me several times in front of my family in the middle of the night, saying I’m crazy and I’m the reason she has so many issues. Our relationship ended after several times where she stopped responding to me for weeks on end and she finally told me she couldn’t do it anymore, and she had to get away from me. We didn’t speak for weeks until we agreed to try to be cordial and still be friends. Looking back it was a huge mistake. I called her one night and she had a random guy answer threatening to come to my house and beat my ass in front of my family because she told him I was harrassing her. I had left her alone and hadn’t even seen her in weeks and was completely thrown off by this and scared for my safety at the same time. He told me he had my address and was coming to me after he left a club, which I was close to at the time. I told him I was coming to him. I wasn’t going to fight, which I told him, but I was not going to be threatened anymore by this girl and some random person when I arrived she started arguing with me in the street to which I just started telling her friends that she was an abusive piece of shit and she was lying on me out of guilt. I had never spoken to anyone about the physical abuse she put me through before this. I was embarassed and felt immasculated by it but the emotions in the moment made me not care. She left and so did I and on my drive home she called me again, saying everything she could to hurt me, telling me she wants me to kill myself and how she’s still going to send people to my house to hurt me. I told her we can’t keep going back and forth like this, and I will not tolerate her threatening me anymore and that we need to squash this for good. I told her I was going to head to her house and she said fine, which was the biggest mistake I’ve ever made. When I got there, she pulled off, still in her car and I followed behind, still on the phone, begging to just talk. Then she pulled into a parking lot down the street from her home and stopped. I thought she was finally going to talk so I parked my car on the curb outside the lot and started to get out. As soon as I stopped, she pulled out of the other entrance and swiped the back of my car. I got out to see the damage and saw she drove down the street and had stopped and was yelling about her car being damaged. I drove down next to her so we could call the police. I got out of the car and approachd hers and she was on the phone with someone, I could hear her telling them that I’m crazy and that it was all my fault. At that point something snapped in me. The anger and resentment from the year+ of being abused and blamed for everything erupted out of me and I started punching the window of her car, causing it to shatter in her lap. She screamed and took off and I immediately realized the huge mistake I had just made and left messages apoligizing and begging to let me fix the damage I caused. With no response and fearing the worst, I went home. The next morning I was arrested at my home, charged with 3 felonies and two misdemeanors, she told the police that I had been abusing her for months and that I rammed my car into hers causing the damage. I only spent a day in jail but my life was changed forever. Throughout the court proceedings she piled even more lies on, like saying she tried to break up with me but I would threaten to kill myself and that I would stalk her at her job. Neither of which were even remotely true. My lawyer convinced me to take a plea, saying he couldn’t guarantee I wouldn’t face any jail time, for almost 5 years probation for two felonies. I had no prior criminal history. Now, about 6 months into this probation, I cannot stop thinking about how my life is destroyed. I made terrible mistakes, and allowed someone to abuse me over and over again and now my life is worthless and has no future. Even if I get through this probation, I will never be hireable, I will never be able to live this down. I still need to finish college but I don’t see the point because I won’t be able to be employed afterwards. Right now I work a semi decent hourly job, but not enough to take care of myself, especially with my student loans looming. Legally I am a woman beater even though I’ve never laid a hand on a woman and I am a felon for 5 years. If I could end it all right now I would. I wish I was dead, I am a waste of human life.

"It was not obvious at first but everyone I loved, cared, friends, relationships have left me.It is time for me to check in I guess. It has been years since I’m over addiction and hardcore depression but recently I started thinking of doing it again as I have made terrible choices and some mistakes that I don’t even know what they are as I’m not being told but at first a couple not really close friends stopped talking with me in groups I asked them for a while and got no reply and later I heard they do not want me anymore and this was after a terrible breakup with a person I loved the most and probably hurt the most during breakup, anyway. Later I wasn’t in any groups, nobody was messaging me and I started talking with them but most people had no interest or was just trying to get done with it. And later one my closes friends since childhood openly stated he is not talking to me anymore and said he will never say why and I shouldn’t ask. I made new friends but can’t trust and even the new ones I made was there for my past or current successes or looks or whatever and when they were done, they just left. I literally have nobody to talk to and I even hate looking for a friend or someone offering out of pity as it feels extremely condescending. I am willing to do all the hard work, years of work, at the pace it needed to be, but for most I don’t even know why they don’t see me fit anymore as I was once adored. For the ones I know the reason even if I did everything they see as right for them even on my deathbed I know I would never hear let’s say my ex, the person I was with longest, loved immensely, profoundly, with my everything, I wouldn’t be forgiven. I hate myself and I have nobody to listen how I hate myself. I will keep on moving forward better learned from my mistakes and never repeat, I know but when something good comes to me there is always an expiration date I can see but ignore. If I dropped dead, nobody would even know anymore. I want to feel loved again and I am sober 2+ years but God is it tempting. Like you give them everything and assure mutuality and those friends you had for years with a mistake or even with nothing as I do not know just disappear, live happily and leave you fucked up.

My friend had died from choking on his vomit after too much booze and benzos.. . I snapped and smashed my whole house. Many of my favorite possessions were destroyed.  All my friends stopped talking to me because i snapped and I ended up living with this girl for a while and we got together. Even friendships like 12 years old stopped because I snapped. Things were not great we fight a lot and she has hit me a few times in the past but I have no other friends so I still see her. It is nice to atleast have someone to talk to instead of sitting in my house alone every day.. . I got too sick to work and had to quit my job. Ran out of money and I have to move back in with my parents at the end of the month. I'm totally freaking out about that.. . I can't see anything in my life improving. I had such bad brain fog and anxiety I can't learn anything new. My job was all physical labor and I'm too sick for that now. I lost all my friends and I'm too sick and depressed to even leave my house let alone make friends. I burp constantly all day and I'm really gross to be around. I'm super high maintainance and I have to have a premade meal with me every where I go.. . I can't see anything more for my life then sitting around my parents house watching TV til they kick me out and I move into some shitty room on welfare and do nothing alone until I die.. . I really don't see the hope anymore. I used to smoke weed to calm down and every time I smoke now I just get panic attacks so I literally have 0 relief whatsoever.. . I don't want to live anymore. I'm really contemplating killing myself. This is a pathetic excuse for a life.,suicide
"A lost GeminiFunny how one can be the most inspirational, happy person to others, and then one day feel like there’s nothing left to offer. . Im always told how wonderful and beautiful I am and it’s makes me angry now. I find joy in the thought of giving up and starting over. I’m not sure what happens when one decides to die but it would feel better than having to feel so trapped in skin I can’t escape from. . I’ve lost everything..most of all myself. Anger and sadness have taken over every inch of my nerves and I want those feelings gone. It’s been a year feeling like this life is a huge mistake. Like every moment has been wasted and there’s no time I can get back or fix. . Today..endless sleep is all that I can think about and I find so much peace knowing I can follow through with SOMETHING now.

"Ever wonder that us suicidals is just nature's way of culling off the weak?I searched here because I know I'm not alone and tell my story...  but then I see there are so many of us. I look at outsiders (because I have no friends) and wonder ""how must it feel to wake up each day confident with who you are?"". I'm talking about deep down confidence. Not superficial shit about how one looks in a bikini. I'm talking about the kind of confidence where a person **lives their life as if it means something** regardless of the faults that everyone has. . . I'm 30. No job, no friends, no family. Nothing. Oh wait I have PTSD. And debt. And anger. Anger at all these fucking patronising, upbeat, yellow and pink ribboned fancy anti-suicidal threads that for the most part (not all) are created by people who just have zero clue. And if you do have a clue remember that all this upbeat  ""it'll get better"" shit is just offensive. . . . **""Oh this is fucking temporary is it?""**. . . **""Oh my life is fucking precious, I'm unique, I'm beautiful on the inside and deserve something!""**. . . **""easy for you to say it'll get better!""**. . . ---------------------------------------------------------------. . . Pfft. I know people who have gone therapy and it's worked. For their sake I let them believe this bullshit but the mere thought at saying those words aloud leaves a bad taste in my mouth. When this crap is spewed at me by people that don't have a fucking clue I just look them in the eye and nod politely. . . . **""STFU and get over it"", some say.**. . . **""My god aren't you a self-absorbed prick?"" others.**. . . **""Fucking hell you wont get anywhere with an attitude like that!""**. . . . SO what I'm a defeatist? I don't know any other way. I would love to be unfazed by all the bad shit thrown my way. I have known a couple people with perfect lives - perfect being nothing PTSD inducing, comes from money, a loving family and the biggest crisis they had was turning in an assignment late costing them another year at uni. And they bounce through life without a care in the world and great success. Upbringing and environment counts for something. . . . No one thinks I'm worth anything least of all myself. Not for a friend, a worker or as a lover. I'm just here to be culled but nature is efficient so I have to do it myself. ",suicide

I fough these thoughts very hard, I haven't had them since the last year (for about 7-8 months) but now they are back. I do no even know why to be honest.

"Today I had a party at my place (a small studio with 3 chairs) and accidentally posted a pic of my (male) friend sitting on my bed, which is right next to the beer pong table, on my story.My boyfriend (long distance-ish) saw it while I was having a panic attack due to the amount of ppl that ended up in my apt and I was trying to call him for help but then he told me that I ruined his night.  I felt so alone and like such a burden even tho I had all these ppl around me and repeatedly tried to ask him to just talk but he was just treating me like how I felt was an overreaction for his attention. I have never felt so alone and so many negative thoughts about myself have been released by my depressive floodgates. I couldn’t stop myself from cutting and I kept asking him if he could just call me so I could hear his voice and calm down so I could stop harming myself but he refused and I have never wanted to kill myself more.

"I don’t know what to doI’m a 17 year old male. I am a senior in high school and don’t turn 18 until August 21. My parents have always been over protective and controlling. My parents forced me to break up with my girlfriend back in October. Now any time they mention her they refer to her as that stupid little whore or that tramp. It’s always something like that and it makes me so mad I can’t control myself. My parents are constantly pressuring me about things in general such as grades. I’m told on a pretty regular basis that I’m just a lazy piece of shit. My father tells me that I live like a fu***** ni**er. I’m told that I’m ungrateful for everything. When I was around 10 years old, my father had an affair and he let me meet the woman. He would make me tell her things like how great of a stepmom she would be. When he would take me to her house, I would be left to care for the woman’s 4 year old son while they went into the bedroom to have sex. I’m always getting screamed at and cursed at. I honestly just can’t take it anymore. Being in this house makes me feel like I’m going insane. I’m constantly on the verge of a panic attack while in this house and I feel that the only way out of it is to kill myself. I don’t want to kill myself but at this point it seems like the only option. I have a counselor but haven’t told him about my suicidal thoughts due to fear of being sent off to a mental institution. I can’t see the person I love, I hate my household and my parents. What’s the point of even staying alive? I’ve talked to an attorney about emancipation but with me being so close to 18, it would be useless. I’ve called the runaway hotline, the suicide hotline. They have both told me to speak with my counselor about my options to get out. The only other option I can see is contacting DCS but at the same time I feel like I’m just being a bitch and they won’t even do anything for me.

"I need to help a friendMy roommate is strongly thinking of suicide. He's been severely clincly depressed for most of his life but lately he has been psychotically depressed.. . When he has been drunk, he claims he is the second coming of Jesus Christ and I think he believes it when he's sober as well. When he's been nearly sober, he has stated how he puts a gun in his mouth every day and tries to pull the trigger. At this point, he sleeps all day and is doing nothing at night except drinking and watching anime. He leaves the seat in front of the TV for very little and it is incredibly upsetting to me.. . The worst part is that our two closest friends are little to no actual help for him. He refuses to accept that he may need medication or therapy or really anyone who is certified professionally to help him cope. He is insistent that he will be a zombie or worse if he is medicated despite having evidence that would not be the case. Then add at least one of those two friends is enabling and reinforce that believe that he meds are a bad idea and he does not need to talk to anyone but that one friend.. . He owns several guns in my house where he lives with me and I know he has plenty of ammo. He has tried to cause a severe car accident to kill himself and then blamed it on saying he 'hit a deer'. His behavior has been severely disturbing at times and despite that I know alcohol is the reason for those flare ups, I know that there is a much deeper problem. I know he will never be able to move forward to a better place unless he seeks some professional help.. . All of this stems from work related stress and that's never going to be resolved without him getting real help. I can not control him and I can force him to see some one or take meds. I was in a place with him where he was almost willing to but that one friend convinced him not to try and that he didn't need it after the most recent incident. . . I do not know what to do because I know I can't be there to make sure he will not kill himself every day. I do not know for sure that he will succeed at his attempts either. I am not willing to take a chance on this and I want to make sure he survives. I know medication and therapy is the right choice and he will not do that.. . It is ruining me on a daily basis and I am almost expecting him to try and succeed again at any moment. I cannot feel comfortable with him in my home without him doing something to show me a step in the right direction to care for himself. I cannot live with this stress and I do not know what to do any more.. . If he will not get therapy or meds I need him out of my house because I am in no place to deal with this. I don't know what to do and I need help for him. I need help for me too because this is too much for me to handle. I can not sleep and I am having trouble eating even making sure I can focus on myself with him like this.. . I need him to do something, anything positive for me, and he will not.

"There are two parts of me. (Edit: getting used to mobile formatting, put space for paragraphs). . The part of me that wants to kill myself, and the part of me that wants to live. I mostly feel the former. Most days I don't have the energy to leave my bed or the couch. I sit at home alone all day wasting my time. Each day I realize how pointless it is for me to even try because I know even if I choose to live I will always be depressed for the rest of my life..  . When Chris Cornell killed himself a few months ago, I had an epiphany. Since then, I have no longer ask myself the question 'do I actually want to kill myself'. I no longer ask myself that question because Cornell's death made me realize that is is not an 'if' question, but a 'when'. . . But then there is the rare few days where I sober up from my depression and I actually feel for a little bit. I feel love for my family and friends. I am excited to learn new things. I genuinely feel a strong core identity of who I am and what I want. Sadly these days are so few and far inbetween.. . It was raining yesterday when I woke up. I laid in bed for hours mindlessly browsing reddit and youtube. I did finally get out of bed but I just went straight to the couch where I did the same all day. I haven't done anything productive in months and I am getting so fucking bored of this cycle where I try to distract myself from my own thoughts.. . Now that winter is coming I can look forward to overcast, cold rainy days for the next forever. The part of me that knows I want to live is worried because I know that my depression is so much worse  in the winter. And the way things are looking I honestly don't think I am going to make it until 2018. I know exactly where and how I am going to kill myself. Fuck this life.

I thought it was weird that she wouldn't answer me for the last 5 days or so. And suddenly, yesterday, my mother-in-law called to ask why my father was in the hospital. I had no idea he was in the hospital. Some other backstory needed is my mother-in-law went to the hospital about a month and a half ago, nothing serious. She didn't tell us, she only posted about it on Facebook. Well my mother blew up my phone demanding why I didn't tell her, and why she had to find out on Facebook. I told her I had no idea what she was talking about, but then I saw the post. And she bitched me out for not telling her when I didn't know, and she refused to believe I didn't know.. . That matters because my mother posted about my father being in the hospital on Facebook. I don't get on Facebook that much for my mental health. So when I asked her why my mother-in-law/Facebook had to tell me about my father because she was being a massive hypocrite, she told me that she texted me (she has no proof she texted me, and I have no texts from her), and then she told me, ""Well, I emailed it to you, too.

It was the night of prom (yes, we just finished high school) and afterwards we were at a friends house. The house was empty and my girlfriend and I were making out.

I said that we wouldn't. She agreed, we went and had sex. Things seemed fine. But later I found out she felt forced and violated. Now she feels worthless and says she doesn't want to live cause she wasn't able to completely say no for a second time. She had some issues with a previous guy during our relationship but it never got physical, he just guilted her into into having sexual conversations, sending him pictures, etc. I forgave her cause I could see he had her trapped in a cage and was guilting her into this stuff. I helped her out. Thats why this is the second time. . . But I feel so responsible for what happened. I feel like I shouldn't be allowed to live for what I did to her and making her not want to live.

"Not depressed, but in a very-very bad situationWell, I've never had an easy life (none of us ever have), but now the situation is an inch away from a disaster. I'm 22, and only now I've matured enough to understand what the heck is going on. And the situation screams red alert. My whole life I've been oppressed by my family who treated me not like a depressed teenager (back in the day when I was 12-15), but rather a vile and sleazy liar and evil-doer. Looking back, I still don't understand such an attitude. I was a goddamn child, why was there such an intimacy? Right now I'm sitting on a bench typing this out with my old iphone4, I'm afraid Safari will crash, so I'll submit the post now and update it further just in a minute, sorry for such an inconvenience.. With that treatment I couldn't study and do things very well. There was always a chance I can get in big trouble because of some little thing which I didn't to because I was too depressed and anxious to think about it. My head was always in those clouds of depressed state, only now I'm able to think straight. So here were my teenage years, sometimes I effed up really bad and was punished for it. I finished high school and was looking to study in a university. I didn't plan too much, I didn't know what I was good for and let my folks choose it for me. It's only now that I understand I should've started English courses (I'm russian, by the way, so forgive my possible lack of needed English) or programming. Not journalism. I'm not good for it. So I didn't attend summer internship or whatever it is called (when you work for some real newspaper or journal) and it was mandatory. Right now the university wants full report of it and I can't hand them one 'cause of obvious reasons. I stopped going there a week ago. My parents pay for that course and I've been living with my abusive older sister (we both own the place we live in), her PoS husband and their kid. . I know I shouldn't talk like that, but a month ago her husband attacked me physically, sister kicked him out but then let him back in, I don't contact him anymore despite living under the same roof (he's gone for two month now working, thankfully). And it has always been that way that I live with someone despising me. I want out. I thought A LOT about running away, but where? Don't have money for that. Even if I found where to work right now, I'd have to live in the streets anyway. It's going to be a disaster when my family finds out I'm on the verge of being expelled. So, with that suicide seems like an only option available. I don't even want to live in hell that my life will inevitably become. I don't want to die, I definitely don't, but it seems like the only way out. Unless magic happens and I'm transferred to some other city or country with a place to stay. The end.",suicide

I said that I would wait for her to get out and that I wouldn't but I don't know anymore. It all seems so horrible now and I just can't take it.

"No one ever fucking caresI have spent my whole life being that nice, quiet, good listener because I just believe those are some of the best qualities to have in a person. But I have had it up to here and I need someone to actually listen to ME for once in my life. . . Let me start by saying this: I know there is a higher being above me who is the cause of all my misfortune. He/she/it decided that my life should just be shitty but not shitty enough for anyone to care about, right? Why the fuck did it have to be me?. . And why should I get to be angry? I'm only 16, right? I don't even fucking KNOW how bad life can be. I get it. That doesn't mean all my problems should magically go away just because I'm not middle aged with bills or a stressful job or a midlife crisis. . . No one gives a shit about me. They just pretend to. Every time I complain about my problems or try to vent, no one cares. They just worry about themselves.  I don't get it. I genuinely care about a lot of people and it fucking hurts when they don't feel the same. Sure, I have friends, but they can't help or understand how I feel.. and I know that sounds so cheesy and cliche but I don't care because it is the most accurate way to describe it.. . My self esteem never fucking took off like I thought it would when I became a teenager.  Thought I would be living it up.. having tons of friends and going to dances with guys.. boy was I wrong. No one wants to make new friends when they already have their designated group. Sure, I love my friends, but the clique situation at my school is ridiculous. I can't meet anyone new because I'm not popular. I believe I am pretty sometimes but then I realize no guy likes me and obviously there is SOMETHING wrong with me. . . Approximately one guy has ever had a crush on me and he was creepy as hell not to mention never fucking TRIED TO TALK TO ME. I don't get it. The one thing that brings my self confidence up is when I think a guy likes me. every time I delude myself into thinking someone likes me.. I almost have a shred of self confidence for a few seconds.. jokes on me right.. I should know better than that by now.. . . The saddest thing is that I have tried. I push myself too hard and I care too much. I pushed myself to get a part time job.. I pushed myself to get all A's.. and I feel like I'm at the breaking point. I try to be open and friendly but no one reciprocates. I feel like I'm here solely for others. . . None of it matters. It doesn't mean shit if I can't be a fucking SOCIAL BUTTERFLY and not be afraid of rejection. . . Sure, I'll get a good job and get a good salary and what not, but I'll never be truly happy. I have this illusion of being happy, and that's having a boyfriend.. DO NOT TELL ME HOW SHALLOW/CHILDISH/IMMATURE THAT SOUNDS. YOU THINK I DON'T FUCKING KNOW THIS? It's sad, sure. But the feeling of being loved more than a friend, being thought of romantically, that's all I really want... I don't want a hobby. I have those. I don't need to focus on school. I have spent my whole school career pushing myself to get straight A's. Focusing on school will not solve my problems. I just want to feel like someone cares about me. . . I KNOW what you're thinking: ""People on this subreddit have real problems and you are a stupid teenager just complaining about lack of love life. Grow up."" This is what bothers me. Everyone just waves my problems off like they don't matter. No one cares what a stupid teenager has to say. My ""lack of love"" has depleted all my self-esteem and made me suicidal.. . I have contemplated suicide on and off since I was about 11. Being bullied and whatnot hasn't helped my self confidence either. Sometimes it gets really bad, like right now, and I feel like drowning. I actually took a bath today and held my breath for as long as I could, just to see if I could do it. But for some reason, I don't have the lady-balls to do it. I feel like there has to be SOMETHING or SOMEONE for me out there. But right now, I don't care much for living through the ""best years of my life"". . . **P.S.

"I've promised myself I wouldn't...I guess this is just here to tell my story and have at least one person who will listen. First off, I'd like to say that I've promised myself that I wouldn't commit suicide. There's far too many problems associated with that option, but that doesn't mean that I don't keep thinking about it.. That I don't keep idealizing it.. . I just feel like I have so much pain.. I've gone to three people about it so far, but either I'm bad at explaining it, or it's pretty much fundamentally incomprehensible. I feel like my body is somehow wrong, and that there is a body that is somehow right. I feel like I'm crazy for thinking this. My mom thinks I'm crazy, my best friend thinks I'm crazy, and I get the feeling my counselor just wants me to move on from it. It's like they think that it's just a phase, and that doesn't help that I fear the same thing... At least they're accepting of it in a way.... . I want to be female. But I know that going for that via hormones, life style changes, and surgery won't give me want. I don't think that I'd be able to pull it off, and I already have a life as people know me, and from what I've seen so far, they wouldn't really be able to accept me that way. Not really. I'd just be weird to them. I'd still be male in their minds. I know this, because I feel the same way. It would just be easier if I were born female.. Of course, one of the problems is that I don't fully accept certain feelings associated with it. I mean: it really is crazy. But at the same time, it's me. And if there's anything I've learned from this it's that, identity is one of the most complex things in the world. I want to be able to accept it, though.. . I don't know. I think this has basically turned into a rant at this point... I guess that's all this is really.... . I started typing this with the purpose of getting this off my chest somehow. I've already told others, but they don't understand. I've told others who have, but only online and my mom kinda wants me to stop doing that. Again, I fear that she thinks this is just a phase and that me talking to others who feel the same way is somehow keeping me like that... It's just caused me so much pain, and she's really only trying to help, but at the same time, she just can't deal with it... You see, my dad past away recently, and that's causing her enough stress as it is, but I still need help. I still want someone who I can physically go to, have them understand my pain, my feelings, my thoughts, and hold me as I cry... I've done that so much lately.... . I've lost hope. I don't what to do anymore. Nothing I can think of would really help, and anything that I can, I just can't see it happening. I feel alone, even when surrounded by others, even when I'm talking to someone who feels the same way and actually can understand... A physical embrace would be so nice.... . Anyway, thanks for listening. I've promised myself I won'd, but if you can still give me a reason to look forward to the rest of my life, it would be nice.... I'm only seventeen, and I know I have my whole life ahead of me, and I know I act like a child about this sometimes, but... I hate this pain, I hate that I can't run away from it, and I hate how I react to it... I hate myself.... . And I'm sorry...",suicide
"I want to know if a girl likes me. Hey guys, I'm currently friends with a girl that I've known for about a year, and I've liked her for some time now. I'm going to dump a lot of information here, so I'd really appreciate it if you took the time to read through it and give me advice.. . * I told her that I liked her last year, and she told me that she didn't want to date anyone due to the loads of schoolwork our school imposes on us.. * Heard from one of her close friends that she talks about me a lot.. * During interactions, we've accidentally touched each other in spots that would be classified as inappropriate, but she seemed fine with it. I was mortified at first because I'm usually pretty shy and reserved with physical contact, but she either didn't notice or pretended to not notice. . * I think she likes to talk to me--she frequently initiates conversation and keeps it going for a long time when we're in the same room. During our free block, she often asks me to keep her company and hang out with her. She's usually loquacious with everyone, though. I tried to apply the ""dilated eye"" trick on her because she makes eye contact with me a lot, but it's kinda difficult to tell. . * People have commented on how close in proximity we are when we're together. When we're walking, our arms frequently brush each other and she often hangs on to my backpack. I've seen her hold other friends' backpacks, but not as often as she does to mine. . * We usually sit next to each other, but when she wants to show me something on her computer, I go over to her. Sometimes, she initiates physical contact and rubs/puts her hand on my shoulder, punches my chest, or playfully hits my arm. She jokingly tells me that she hits me because she enjoys causing me pain. I try to reciprocate by doing similar things (save the chest punches) such as leaning on her shoulder, tousling her hair, and punching her arm lightly, and she seems fine with it. However, she doesn't reciprocate as much when I reciprocate. Sometimes I try not to do anything, and she engages in the same playful physical contact without pause. A few days ago, while she was talking to me, I gently stepped on her foot. We have this thing where she would step on my foot, after which I would step on her foot resting on my foot, and she would step on my foot, which would be above her foot, which would be above mine. I tried that a couple of times, but she didn't respond and kept staring at me and talking. . * We sometimes wrestle/play fight each other after teasing each other. I'm quicker verbally, so I usually end up getting the last word in, and she jumps at me. . * She laughs at a lot of things I say, even though they're sarcastic asides or bad jokes, and she frequently gets really hyper around me.. * She told me that even if she liked someone, she wouldn't tell him. I don't think that's very good for my prospects with her. . . I'm sure she likes me as a friend. Do you guys think it goes further than that?",non-suicide

"I'm depressed, sure, but I'm more just not interested in the futureYeah, theres the depression and pain, the sadness and the agony, mental health issues and early signs of schizophrenia, and an inability to connect with people and the health issues that are going to make life hell at 40/50. But I don't think most of that would make me suicidal.. . I think the disinterest, the idea that there is no good future for me or enjoyable life, that my chosen interests in art can't provide financially or support me, that I'll never achieve goals and that the goals I have aren't long term or sustaining financially and possibly emotionally.. . I read a lot and I know I'm not going to find answers in literature, or anywhere else, because nobody has the answer, but I feel like I'm able to get a better understanding of people and life and morality, yet in the end I feel like none of it matters so it's a waste of time.. .

Her mix however is Japanese and British.. My mix is Irish, and Bajan.. My mother never really knew how to take care of my hair. As I grew older my grandmother told me to cut my hair.  . . That's not true though. It was my father who told me to cut my hair. I don't know why I stuck to that story for so long.. . I was often bullied for my skin colour, my hair...  I couldn't understand it.. I didn't get the joke, or that I was the joke. . My mother is a blonde with green eyes. I myself have green eyes and brown hair.. My skin is not very dark.. Yet I was always compared to shit.. . I remember a girl hit me and pulled my finger back as I rose my hand to answer a question. I cried of course, and when the teacher asked her ""Why?"" Her response was as simple as ""She's different than *us*"". When I tried to point out the prejudice in her statement I was scolded and sent back to the classroom.. . Anyways,. I later permed my hair, straightened it and it was destroyed. Short, dry hair.. Finally into my adult life (about 20 years of age) I decided to grow it.. It took a long while for it to repair itself.. . I wore my hair down at work today. . Threw together the shaggiest outfit In existence, paired it with some two dollar flip flops and headed out.. . My day was the same. Nothing eventful or new.. One co-worker even said to me ""You look like you got smashed last night."". However towards the end of the day many of the girls were complimenting my hair, saying how healthy it looked. . I became really self conscious after that.. . I hate standing out. . I fidgeted with my hair all the way home.. I thought my hair looked ugly that day, but they kept saying how pretty it was.. . It adds to me feeling like everything is fake, or my perception is incredibly flawed.. It was comparable to when you see a very fat person, and tell them they are fit. . .. . Like it's a lie.. . Anyways. Acceptance from my peers or compliments doesn't change anything.. I still feel so blurry.. . On the upside, I finally have beautiful curly hair.. . 6 days and counting.. ",suicide
"Need advice at 1 am So I’ve slowly realized I let fear control my life, I don’t do things in fear of looking stupid despite not thinking it’s dumb when other people do it, I don’t talk to people in fear of them not even wanting to talk to me and make them feel weird, fear of doing things just because it involves bare minimum human interaction. A complete loser, so (no offence) I know this isn’t the best place to ask but, does anyone have ways to help not letting fear control my life so much?",non-suicide

"I think I need to do it tonightI'm Aleks. I'm a 17 year old high school senior from a somewhat big city in my home state. This time last year, things were great, but now I think I need to go through with it.. My girlfriend of over a year and a half broke up with me a couple of months ago. That was the first nail in the coffin. We're still ""friends"", but she treats me poorly and I feel like a nuisance to her all the time. It hurts because I feel so unloved. My friends don't like me anymore; in fact, today I got ditched even though hanging out with them was what was getting me through the week. I have deep feelings for a friend of mine, but he's straight, and it kind of breaks my heart. To really add onto this bullshit, I have many very strong symptoms of bipolar disorder, and I feel unstable all of the time.. Senior year has put me through the ringer. I can't really do this anymore. I've gone back to self harming and going back to my eating disorder behaviors that I dropped over a year ago. I used to see a future for myself, but now I don't. I don't see myself going to prom, or graduating, or starting college. . I have a plan. I'll ask a friend of mine (the guy I happen to like) if he can take me to a park nearby and just leave me there. I plan on jumping into the river, maybe with weights around me. I don't know how to swim anyways. I wrote a ""will"" of some sorts that I can leave behind, I just need to write letters for certain people in my life. I just feel legitimately hopeless now. I honestly don't believe life is for me, and that's okay. I've come to terms with it. I feel as though me committing suicide was just written into my ""life story"" beforehand, you know?. If you're still reading this, thank you. My time on this app has been short lived, but that's okay. I guess I'll keep whoever cares posted if I happen to not do it. Have a nice day, everyone.

"I've been a victim of rape and sexual abuse, AND now I realize Im Also an abuser and I want to end itI'm a woman. I've been thinking about the ways I've been sexually abused and I realized that I have dome some terrible similar things. I feel like a failure, an impostor. . . When I was 16 I had a boyfriend. He broke up with me. I was an emotional mess because of the bullying I suffered, the domestic violence my mom, my sister and I suffered because of my step father, and the sexual abuse I has recently been a victim off.. . WE were both at a party. I got drunk. We went to a separate room to talk, and I started crying. We hugged and kissed AND I was soon on top of him. I told him i didn't want him to leave me. At one moment he said he wanted to leave. I didn't want to be alone. I held him begging him not to leave me. He couldn't leave. So at one moment he pushed me in order to leave the room. I slapped him in front on everyone. . . After that I apologized and we became friends. . . A year later WE were both really drunk and I was trying to kiss him and I passed out drunk on top of him, he tried to remove me but couldn't. He had to yell to get some friends to make me leave. I don't remember any of this. The next day we were together drunk AND we were foreplaying but nothing happened. The very next day we were also drunk and I asked him if he wanted me to blow him. He was hesitant but he said yes so I blew him but asked me to stop so I did. He later fingered me but he didn't feel confortable so he stopped. Then we just sat and we laughed. I remember I asked him if I could borrow his phone because I wanted to phone my mom. He told me jokingly that I had to blow him first and we laughed.. . I feel terrible because I feel like I forced him since he was hesitant. The fact that he joked about It later makes me think that It was consensual but at the same Time I feel like maybe he didn't know how to react, that maybe I did forced him. Maybe I did hurt him. And I did hurt him before.. . After this WE continued being friends. A few months later he called me while being drunk AND told me that the night I blew him he didn't want to continue because of his religious beliefs (sex until mariage). He told me he wanted to do it but at the same time he didn't because he though It was wrong. I told him It didn't matter anymore AND that I understood His reasons. . . This makes me feel horrible. I truly feel like a rapist. Then he told me that he would have liked to have sex with me if I hadn't had sex with another person that same week. . . WE continued being friends after this. I stopped drinking and using. I moved to another country. Started college. . . One day we were talking over Messenger. We were talking about all of this. I apologized for everything, for the ways I used to be, the ways I hurt him.. . He said I messed up all those times. He talked about that one time I passed out on top of him and had to be lifted by some friends in order to make me go. He said he didn't want to do anything at that time and that I messed up.. . We continued talking normally. Being friends, we saw each other. He's in a happy and healthy relationship. He seems happy.. . But his past 3 years we grew appart.. . I've been recently thinking about the sexual abuse and rape I was a victim of.. . I learned about safe sex, consent, abuse. . . But thinking of the ways I have been a victim of all of this, made me realize I have been violent and a horrible person. Thinking that I have done the same things that have made me suffer to someone else. I feel terrible AND I deserve it.. . I recently wrote him. We talked a bit about how we were doing. He's still with his girlfriend, he seems happy. He said he's glad I'm doing fine. . . But I still feel terrible about the ways I've been. I can't help but feel that i'm a rapist AND a sexual abuser. I've gone to therapy and seen a psychiatrist. I've shared this with my current partner, and another ex. They both said I was young and wrong, but that I can't keep thinking about it, and that I have grown. Ok, I hear that, but it doesn't justify it, nothing does. And ok, maybe I've changed, but that doesn't change the past. . . I feel guilt. I feel like an impostor. I know I deserve all of this feelings. This Is nothing compared to what I have done. I just want everything to end. I don't know what I can do. . . I feel like I deserve everything that has happened to me. I want to die. . . . I can't stop thinking about this, having nightmares, obsessing, reliving every moment I have suffered and made someone suffer. I just want to die",suicide

"I wish that my life mattered more, but it doesn't.I'm currently 30 years old.  As a little background, I dealt with a short bout with depression during my teen years and eventually overcame those issues of not wanting to live anymore and feeling like life wasn't worth living.  I tried having a positive outlook on life for a number of years after my high school years, and for a while it worked but then a couple of years ago I just felt like a lonely life failure and heavy depression set in.  I haven't been able to get a career path going, haven't found or discovered any talent for a career path so I feel talentless.  Haven't been able make any close friends or long term connections, no one in particular to enjoy hobbies with to keep my mind away from stress of life going wrong.  Not once in my adult life have I had a long term romantic relationship or physical affection of any kind to hold onto, even though many people I meet have told me how wonderful of a person I seem but that doesn't seem to change the fortunes of my love life.. . I went to a mental health facility a few months ago after I revealed to my parents that I felt like going through with taking my own life, just ending it.  Admittedly while the process felt like it dragged on a bit, it seemed positive at the time and I did meet some neat people going through similar rough patches in life.  People who just needed someone to talk to like I did, to not feel alone anymore.  I went through some different kinds of group therapy sessions and it was a good experience overall to be honest, the people working at the mental health center along with some of the other people admitted there helped me feel less empty than I had felt in a long time.  There's one person I still talk with occasionally from that place who's a great person, but the the empty void of not having any close connections or a significant other, or someone to enjoy nerdy hobbies with, still remained.. . I didn't want to use any, but did begrudgingly get on some anti-depressants after leaving the mental health center.  Have been taking those for a few months now.  I followed through on seeing a therapist/life coach in 1 on 1 sessions around once a week.. . I tried shaping things up with myself, looking for work or career paths online, anything in a sort of creative field or video game related field just to feel like I could try doing something with my life instead of feeling lonely and isolated all day with no talent.  I've tried finding some online gaming and Dungeons &amp; Dragons stuff to find people to connect with and become buddies with.. . I've tried 4-5 different online dating sites with a paid subscription.  In the past I tried /r/r4r and OKCupid many times with no luck and rarely got a response.  I've continually tried putting myself out there to find a special someone even if on the inside it was hard to put up a positive image and a smile with how empty I felt on the inside, feeling like I'd never be interesting enough or women wouldn't want me for whatever other reason.. . I've gone through the steps other people wanted me to do and have done my best.   I've asked for so much help the past few years, and no one is able to help.  Not even my therapist, who's a good guy and someone I can vent to but they don't have any concrete solutions to the things that are ailing me.  My mom just keeps saying ""You just haven't found the right person yet.""  I keep telling her not everyone does and that some people just die alone, and that someone isn't just going to magically drop into my life and be interested in dating me and accept me.. . Now instead of feeling heavily depressed with a sinking feeling in my chest everyday, now it just feels more empty and alone with the anti-depressants taking care of some things but not making my life any happier.  I feel like I'm doomed to die alone.. . *Nothing has changed, and I hate it.**",suicide

Like the highs and lows are kind of concerning but I can’t imagine everyone isn’t having those through out the day. And like I said, I’m able to multitask fairly okay so I can like just change what im doing to change my mood or get my mind off something without getting stuck......is this something anyone can relate to?

"I think I just failed an exam, and I think I'm going to get expelled from collegeI've been on academic probation for two semesters, this is the second one. I was told that I had to do well this semester or I wouldn't be able to come back.. . But like an idiot, I didn't. I fucked around like a dumbass, and I didn't study for the exam I had today. I was unable to do like half of it, I ran out of time, even though i could have had extra time I was skipping class so I didn't know the exam was today until it was too late to apply for my 1.5x time. I probably could have sent an email in about that, but I didn't, for whatever reason. I don't know why. . . So anyway, I think I may have just failed that exam, and with it, that class, and with it, my chance to come back next year. I had a choice to take a semester off, but I thought I could do it. I should have known better, that I wouldn't be able to change myself.. . I can't disappoint my parents like this. I had so many plans with this school, but I can't look at my parents' disappointed faces. I don't want to kill myself, I don't, but I can't see any other way to get out of this. I fucked up, and now I just don't want to deal with the consequences, but I feel like they're so bad that if I end up dealing with them I'll end up killing myself anyway, right? I'm feeling so, so so much shame. I don't want to attempt suicide as a cry for help, I think. I don't even have time to think about this. I don't think I'd actually do it, I don't think I have any way to do it. I have all these pills (antidepressants and adhd meds) but I don't want to do that, cuz i've heard it's really painful. . I don't think i'd kill myself, but I'm so close to tears right now. I have just made a mistake that might cost me my entire future, and I'm not sure if I can deal with that. The scariest part is how ""fine"" I feel emotionally. I don't feel scared of the consequences, really? I just....I'm worried of the consequences of the consequences, if that makes any sense.. . I've got another exam tomorrow so i need to spend the rest of the day studying for that, right, so like...I don't have time to do this. . . I just...I don't want to be a disappointment. Everything that has gone wrong is entirely my own goddamn fault, and that's the scariest part. I have no excuse. I have no impulse control, I have no priorities, (well, I do but I fuck up and put them all to video games). . I just...don't think i have any other way out. I'm gonna keep grinding, I have one last grade for that class due next monday, and if i can get a 100 on that, then maybe I've got a chance. But I don't think it's realistic, I feel like I'm doomed, and I fucked up and I'm terrified that I won't be able to keep myself alive, I think. ;-; sorry to bother. I'm not sure what I'm hoping you guys say. this might be more of an /r/offmychest post but since the main worry is the suicide thing i figured i might post it here.. . sory, and thanks",suicide

"I'm tiredFirst of all. Sorry for my English, it is not my first language.. . I'm 30 and I graduated from college in December 2014. I moved to another city after my graduation took place.. . I wanted to pursue graduate school, but I needed to work in the real world. So, I decided to look for opportunities to start building my life.. . It took me about 8 months to find a job. I worked as a Human Resources Analyst for 2 years in a Logistical Company between 2015 to 2017. At that moment I didn't like how things were done there, so I decided to talk to my boss and tell her that I didn't want to continue working with them. Also, I took my like 4 hours fo commute every day. I didn't have time to do anything outside of work, besides running 30 minutes a day.. . I start looking for a job after that. Nonetheless, I didn't get any offer, but I kept sending resumes.. . I spent so many hours, sending emails, looking for websites and offers, contacting people, finding friends that could help. In the end, 0 calls.. . I was unemployed for a year. I found something, but it was just a 2-months project, nothing else. But, I took it and did it. After that, I took another project with the company in another location for 5 months and another one for a month. They didn't have a permanent job vacancy. Many people there have been working for them for years, some for decades. I tried my best, always with a good mood, and tried to help if there were stuff to be done. The last project ended in July 2019.. . I have been looking for a steady-job for so long. I always prepared my interview, I tried to be confident, I took courses, but nothing seems to work, no one offers me an opportunity. . . I'm tired. I don't know what to do now.. . I am afraid to end up homeless or living in a dangerous place. I live in the ""third world"".. . I tried many websites, I contacted so many people. All my friends are doing it so well, and I can't find anything. I just want an opportunity to prove myself. . I've been thinking of ending it all so many times, but I haven't done it, because I love my parents and sister. Just one time, I really think of trying it. But I didn't. . . I always fantasize about that.. . Since college, I always try to make a plan, to develop skills and good habits, and to stick to them.

"Had issues with mental health since i can remember, attempted when i was 8 and i still can't seem to get over my problems.Sorry if all this seems like is a long winge:. . As long as i can remember i've always struggled with how i felt mentally, i have always had bad problems with anxiety, having panic attacks over minor things but i didn't know how to explain it so i just told my mum i was scared and she just told me to not worry about it as there was nothing for me to be scared of. Can't remember quite why i did it as everything around that part of my life feels hazy and alien, but i tried to hang myself off my bunk bed when i was 8 until my mum came in and found me. She was trying to get me to go to a hospital but i begged her no because i didn't want to have to do all of that, and the rest of my family finding out as that would only make the situation worse, and i didn't understand at the time how much i needed it. . . After this i just tried to forget about that whole situation and move on, even though i still had all of these problems  I went through all of primary school just distracting myself and playing video games, and i felt a lot better, but i would always think to myself how weird my point of view of life would seem to me. I get to secondary school, and these problems worsen as i'm trying my best to fit in (average new school problems) and i started to get bullied. A year later these problems worsen, as i started to feel happy with my new hobbies and i surrounded myself with people i enjoy, but i get bullied a lot worse at school. Everyone thought i was gay (even though i'm straight), i didn't even try and speak to anyone, i tried to keep out of peoples way as much as possible but i still had endless amounts of people taking the piss out of me, spreading rumours, tripping me up etc multiple times a day. Lots of days i had people coming after me trying to beat the shit out of me (i live in a very homophobic area) but i stood my ground and they were never successful.. . This bullying carried on every single day for a bit more than another year, and during this time the deciding factor on wether my day was ok was if i had a low or high amount of times that people would try to ridicule me. My school knew about it, but didn't even do anything, and two teachers even joined in on the name calling as it was apparently a joke. After this period of time was over, the quality of my life improved greatly. I turned into the 'popular kid' at school. I started working out, trying harder in my academics, made new friends with stuff to do. (coincidentally the same time i started smoking weed, drinking,popping xanax, etc). I was starting to enjoy my life more, but i still had these problems that i've always had at the back of my mind, but i'm doing my best to ignore them. Shortly after this i did two tabs of acid when i was thirteen (yes i know this was retarded and completely the wrong decision now lol) Surprisingly this went well, i had a great experience, even though my parents came home halfway through me peaking. My life has carried on like this ever since, except i've matured as a person, gotten a lot bigger, focus more on school and cut down drug use to just drinking, smoking weed, and mdma every three months.. . My life is supposedly on the up, as i've managed to hold everything down and better myself as a person, but i still don't feel any happier as i did two years ago. I still cry twice a week, completely break down in school, use drugs to distract myself from my own reality, and i can't form connections with people. I hurt a lot of people's feelings because i don't love anyone, my sister went to uni for months, i never missed her whatsoever, i've lost my bestfriend who i've had my whole life, and i feel exactly the same without them. I use girls to distract me, without developing any feelings for them.. . I want to get some help as anyone in my social standing with all the chances and opportunities i have in my future would currently feel happy, but i don't. I also need to come to terms with what happened when i was younger. In the past few months, my mental wellbeing has declined, my mood getting very low, people around me notice, but they assume i feel unwell. Recently everything seems hazy like i'm watching through a screen, and i don't even remember what i did yesterday (I'm thinking this could be late after effects of my acid trip?) I would go to get help, and there are free places to go for it in my city but everyone i can find who went to these places tells me they are horrible and don't help the problem whatsoever. I would go to see someone like a paid psychiatrist, but i do not have the money and i don't want to ask my mother as i have before and she said to go to these free places, and i don't want to tell her also until i am sure of where i want to go as she worries too much, this just hurts her so i convinced her before that i feel okay. She travelled very far from the bottom and worked very hard to get where she is, which is part of the reason i haven't made a second attempt because it would hurt her way too much. (I'm not the only child i have 5 siblings but my point remains). . I know that i'm only 15 and  my situation will improve and i will succeed in life, but i don't think my mental health will no matter how well i do. Thankyou so much for listening, i greatly appreciate it as i needed to rant to someone.",suicide

No concrete shows, no off a bridge, it’s killing the people that know me the best. That is the best revenge. I hope that split second before they say of like “holy shit my son is going to kill me???” I hope that hurts. And I hope the death actually hurts. . . 3. Torturing my father. Waterboars him for days. Weeks. With an amohetamine IV IN HIS arm. After a few hours of boarding, I’m gonna bend him over and rape him until his anal ruptures then pull it out as much as I can and feed it to him. Then, slowly cut off slices of the fingers. One by one. Till the fingers finished. Then all the fingers, then force feed him, or shove it up his ass. His secret girlfriend?

Take the largest stake knife, and stab her cunt 4 feet deep. And piss and shit on her. . And I’ll rape their son. I’ll rape his little ass. I’ll brake his jaw by how hard I’ll be making him suck me. After the jaws broke, I’ll rip it off. And I’ll dump both of their bodies right on the streets of Manhattan. Let everyone see. . . Back to father. Electrocution and and adrenaline shots for day. Cut off his nose and feed it to him. Beat him senseless. Then, I’m gonna take one of those skinner trees, cut it down, and the trees diameter like A foot, and thrust and thrust until it goes thru the entire body. . . When I’m done, I’ll throw him in the kiddy pool. This is the best part. 4 fucking deep but can’t swim lol. I’m definitely gonna be masturbating to that one. And I’ll rape his dead body every day until he’s rotten. . . My mom and sister are different  they don’t have what I have. They are evil cunts for that. I know they can tell it, but fuck all humanity. Now, it’s about me. I’m just gonna headshot then and leave them. . . I’ll walk through the town and rape every person I see. Until they bleed and their sphincter Rips apart. Then I’m gonna find my psych. Then the neuro, then the GP. . . I’m crushing on a girl right now. She’s cool. But I don’t know her like that. But On God, all I want to do is torture her in so many ways. Cut her ear off and shove it up her ass, make her accept my shit in my mouth and swallow. Fucking pain. It makes me want to cum so ducking hard. . . The idea of getting revenge like this, I’m literally having a boner as we speak. . . Or maybe I should let one of them watch while I tear the other apart. . But I digress. My solution:. . . 1. Shotgun to the brain. Many many times until the face is unrecognizable. Both mom and sister.. . 2. When I’m done killing all these people, I’ll feel normal again. And I would rather die than go with the cops. I’ll pick up some stuff and tell them to meet me at somewhere. When they walk in, I want them to see me covered in shit and piss while I jack my pathetic penis off and shove things in my ass. . Once I start this mission, there is no end. All or nothing. If I happen to see a woman in the middle of this? She’s getting brutally raped until she loses all her fucking blood which I’ll then wet my cock with. Even better if there’s a kid. I’ll rip that shit out, and use his entire body as a flesh light. . . I’m finally ready. I’m more angry than I thought thong goal is to rape at least 10 cunts before I end it. I want to ruin more lives. And right up the asshole dry. . . Christians believe that after some time in lergatorh, we go to heaven!

"I feel empty, I've got nothing leftI've been suffering from depression for a couple of months now. It sort of came out of nowhere. It made no sense at the time because everything in my life was wonderful and happy and I had no reason to be so miserable. Slowly it began destroying everything. I tried an SSRI but it made things significantly worse.. . Throughout it all my boyfriend supported me. It was so hard for us and it challenged us so much, but he stuck by me. I told him everything and he supported us throughout. Yesterday, after what had been a brilliant couple of days, he broke up with me. We always kept having silly little arguments. I know they were triggered by how stressful everything had been, because of me, but for the most part we had been having such good times and being so good to each other. I tried to get him to stay, but he wouldn't, he'd made up his mind. I waited until I was in a more sane mood and sent him a long email telling him everything that I felt. I know he read it, but he hasn't replied. I won't send him another, I know I shouldn't have done that in the first place.. . I've tried everything I can think of. I've got anxieties out of nowhere.

"Survey on the Experiences of Social Media of Teenagers (Please Read fully) Good Day dear subbredditors,. . I'm a student and am currently writing on one of my final papers I have to submit to graduate from school before going to university. I am writing on the topic of ""**Social Networks and their influence on Generation Z**"" and wanted to do a survey, asking teenagers about their experiences with social media. And my first thought was to collect data from people on this subreddit, since there are (hopefully) only people belonging to the age group I'm targeting (not older than 25) and I expect everyone on here to use some form of social media (since you all use Reddit).. . The Survey itself has been **approved by the moderators** and takes not more than **5-10 minutes** of your time. There are **only multiple choice questions**, meaning you don't have to write anything. The data itself can't be tracked back to any individual, since **I won't be asking for any form of identification** (Name, Username, etc.). I am only asking for age, gender and continent you live on, since I need to present the results and I need to know how many percent were female or male, and how old. (Again, all of this can't be traced back to any individual, it is for statistical purpose only).. . I am hoping to get enough responses on here so that I can actually use this survey in my work, and I believe that this community can give enough responses if this gains enough traction. From previous experience I have seen more girls participate in these surveys, so **I am also urging boys to do this, since I am aiming for approximately a 50/50 distribution.**. . &amp;#x200B;. . **The link to the survey is:** [https://forms.gle/rKKgb9rcebgmm2cG9](https://forms.gle/rKKgb9rcebgmm2cG9). . **Again, I want to thank everyone who will take their time to participate in it, and I want to thank the moderators for approving this and giving me the opportunity to do this.**. . &amp;#x200B;. .

"Can’t take joy in my accomplishmentsI’m 34 years old. I divorced 3 years ago. Ever since I decided that I was going to refocus my life, be productive and work hard. I’m a paramedic and when my ex wife left me for another man I decided to do everything I could to be successful. I started going to the gym and eating healthy. I lost 40 lbs and kept at and eventually obtained a very athletic physique that I still maintain today. It’s a part of my lifestyle now. I catch women looking at me all the time, especially when I’m working and I’m in uniform. . . I decided that I also wanted to do more for my career. I decided that I was going to become a doctor. (Seemed the logical step from paramedic). I’ve spent the last 3 years working my ass off at the local community college (I had to do a lot of catching up in math). I have a 3.9 overall gpa and am a member of a couple honors societies. Everyone (co-workers, I don’t have family or friends) seems to be supportive of my educational and career goals. I’ve even had doctors I worked with in a local trauma center tell me that they had no doubt I would get where I wanted to go. . . I’m at the point now where I need to start applying to universities. I started to fill out the application for my top choice and I came to the “personal statement” portion where I’m supposed to write about my educational background, my goals and why I wanted to attend that university. And I had a sudden realization. I have no idea. . . I don’t really take any pleasure or joy in my accomplishments and I don’t think I ever have. I have no one to share them with. And I started to realize that all my hard work and dedication to both my school and physical fitness hasn’t done anything meaningful for my life. I’m still lonely. I’m still sad. I’m still isolated and alone. I’m wondering why I work so hard when the end result will be the same. A life of isolation and loneliness. I just keep going to the gym and working so hard because I literally have NOTHING else in my life except my work ethic. I’m just so god damn lonely and miserable and I have been for so long. Sometimes I wonder if I’m even capable of feeling love and happiness. . . I feel so stupid and selfish for feeling this way. I feel like I have no right to feel this when so many people don’t even get the opportunities to go to school or lack the ability to obtain their goals. But I can’t help but just feel like the hard work doesn’t matter at the end of the day when you’re always going home to nothing but an empty apartment. They say the best things in life are shared.",suicide

"For the first time in years, I stopped watching youtube for an entire month straight. Now this might sound weird, but when I was about 10-11 years old I made a youtube account. And since then I sit down and spend about 6-10 hours daily watching countless videos, channels, streams, etc. Fast forward a couple of years, and I made myself a twitch account. So now I basically have over 180 youtube channels that I'm subscribed to, and over 50  twitch channels that I follow. And of course I didn't know any better but to watch all of them day and night, I just wanted to keep up with everyone.. . My mindset was, that if I wasn't constantly catching up to every teeny tiny detail of what whoever I'm following is doing, what they playing, what updates they have for a long time I wouldn't get anything of what are they doing and what are they playing when I finally start watching them again, and that might make me feel alone and left out.. . But a bit over a month ago I met a couple friends through reddit and added them on discord. We started hanging out almost all day everyday, playing games, reading books, listening to each other's music and tons more fun stuff. But I didn't realize untill recently that I stopped watching my favourite youtubers, and started missing out on a lot of twitch streams. Which for a moment got me pretty upset, but now that I think about it, it's just great. I never felt as free and not attached to anythins as now since I stopped really caring about catching up to the literal hundreds of people that I follow.. . Now I have no idea what you gained from reading this, it's not the ""I stopped self harming for a month/ I haven't been depressed for over a month"" type of story, but hey, thanks for hanging out I guess.",non-suicide

"In UK - what to do for helpI posted on here a few days expressing uncertainty about where to go to get help. I'm not in danger of actually killing myself, but I am thinking about it a lot, am struggling to focus, and am just... having a really hard time. And I don't have a mental health team at the moment and my college doesn't have counsellors, so I don't know who to talk to. I can't talk to friends - I complain to them too much about feelings, and they have a tendency to say unhelpful things. I can't talk to family. I've tried an online suicide prevention thing online before and it was kind of lame, and I don't think it's particularly appropriate to my situation. I don't need somebody to tell me not to kill myself. I'm not entirely sure what I need. Do you ever feel so stressed and like you're having a crisis but people barely even notice, so you want to do something to attract their attention? I know people look down on this type of behaviour a lot, but I kind of want to harm myself in a non-fatal but significant way so as to communicate to people how not okay I am.

"Difficulty coping with being a physically non-desirable man.Sort of bought into the narrative that looks weren't all that important for a man. Pretty ridiculous looking back how I never experienced intimacy with a girl before the age of 25 (and that was with a very low self esteem girl and ended badly) . Always thought my personality was to blame. Sort of kept the wheel turning like an idiot, have a masters degree in physics (did enjoy my time in physics though), went into medicine after that which in hindsight was a stupid decision but I thought it was something I wanted to do at the time. Now a radiologist in training. I'm in a comfy space financially, have a vivid social life (not a lot of close friends though), I do organise sport events (cycling) and other stuff and try building my leadership qualities. I feel bit of satisfaction from time to time, but it's very few and far in between. I'm also getting a bit more female attention now even though I've never been intimate with a second girl. While a intimate relationship is what I desire, ultimately a loving partner I can care and provide for and be cared for by, I don't feel very good about this. I have almost 30years of experience that women are not attracted to me so I can only assume these people want to use me. I've experienced this many times now, only after finding out about my accomplishments, what I work and where I live they warm up to me, I cannot trust them. I know this doesn't sound too terrible but I don't know how to cope with the fact that I jumped through all those hoops to have a shot at getting laid(just a space holder it's not about sex) with someone who'll use and discard me, while better looking people can just experience ""true love"" ... I feel like it's a no win situation and I feel incredibly inferior. The only thing keeping me alive right now are my parents for I don't want to hurt the only people who truly love me and a few friends... ",suicide

I don't think I'll ever find a group of people so compatible or ever bond with someone the same way ever again. we shared so many external and internal issues and being able to commiserate with them was what kept me sane all these years. but then I had to go and ruin it all for myself.

"I guess I want to die?Some signs of depression are as follows; Lack of self worth, Lack of appetite, or Increase in appetite, Sleeping a lot, or almost nothing at all, Feeling tired, Losing interest in things you love, Feeling sad/worthless/suicidal, and more. I can't identify with most of them. Not enough to be labeled with depression.. . Nothing traumatic or horrible has happened, my childhood was okay, I have a few friends, but I don't know what to do. I've never had loads of hobbies, and they just get more frustrating to do the older I get, because it all feels like a competition. I shouldn't draw, cause I'll never be good, I can't draw this, another person is way better. I shouldn't play the piano, cause my friend can play the piano basically fluently, with both hands, and play a song after just hearing it a few times. I shouldn't play any sports, because it'll never do anything for me, the kids will just make fun of how I look, how I play, that I joined so late, that I'm not interesting. I can't sing, I can't dance, I don't enjoy doing almost anything. I don't know what to do anymore. . . People don't enjoy being with me, they never want to hang out or do anything, and neither do I. I stay in my room for hours on end, or just sit with my phone. I don't want to socialize. I can't make any new friends, because I'm not good enough at faking being interesting. . . Even so, the thing I hate most about everything, is I don't know how to get help, or how to fix this. I don't want to talk to someone. Everything small just seems like a huge deal to me, and everything stacks up. I vent about school, how bad I think the teachers are, how much homework we have, and anything bad that happened to me, and people get sick of it. Of course. Who would want to hear someone complain every day, all the time, about everything. I just spread negativity, but that's my way of letting off steam. I don't know how to function without letting these things out, everything just gets bottles up inside, and makes me even more negative. I don't know what to do. I don't want to be only negative, but it's so hard seeing positive things. . . All these things just make me want to die, even though they're all insignificant. Not jokingly, or just saying ""I want to die"", I actually want to shoot myself, hang myself, or anything to just get out. I want to disappear. To be fully honest, I wish I was never born. Then, people wouldn't have to deal with whatever pain they might feel if I die, and no one will remember me. Sometimes, I just want to be alone, in a room, without anyone being able to disrupt me. No annoying knocking, noone to talk to me, no small inconveniences, nothing. Just sit there alone with my thoughts. Just be alone, by myself, gone from everyone else. . . This was super long, with loads of unimportant information that no-one needed to know, nor that anyone cares about. People won't see this, because nobody wants to share my ""burden"". People could care about something more important, someone who can change something, anyone. This post was super egoistic, and I realize it. I don't know if I should've posted this.

"I can't do it anymoreI don't have a plan yet, probably gonna overdose on pills. I've had depression all my life, I was born depressed. These last two years have been the hardest of my life. I've fallen so deep into my depression that I literally can't do anything even slightly challenging anymore. I'm 16 in my sophomore year of high school, I'm a highly intelligent person but my work quality, and efficiency has gone straight out the window. I can no longer bring myself to do so much as read a book, let alone write a fucking paper. I used to love reading, I used to take pride in my school work, I used to be a fucking full on honor student. Now I'm nobody, everyday I fall further down this infinite dark staircase. I've never felt true happiness in my life, and I don't know if I ever will. I'm stuck in this endless cycle of feeling nothing but sadness, and doing nothing but strum my guitar and play my keyboard all day. The only thing I've been able to bring myself to do anymore is to write songs, to act, to sing these are my true passions, but of course I'm never gonna make it in that world. At the rate I'm going I'm gonna end up a junkie singing on the street to make enough money to drink myself to sleep on the sidewalk. I have aspergers so I'm probably doomed to always be fucked up. I'm doing nothing all day everyday and yet I'm still drowning in stress, anxiety attacks, and constant self doubt. I put a lot of value in getting a good education, yet I'm throwing away all my potential, and that's probably the worst part of it all. I watch myself waste my life everyday and I'm powerless to stop it. The only thing that's been going well for me is my arts, acting, singing, writing those are the only things I'm really good at, those are the only things that have ever made me feel close to happy, but I'll never make it. I can't imagine a life where I'm happy doing anything else, and with the way I've been wasting my education I'm not even gonna make it to college. If by some miracle I did make it to college I probably won't be able to handle that workload, and I'd be wasting money trying to build a career that will never pan out. People say it gets better, but my life is only constantly getting worse. I'll never be happy, and what the hell is the point of existing if not to be happy. I failed my first suicide attempt, I'm ready to try again. I'm tired of all this senseless pain, these broken dreams, tired of being to afraid and stuck in my head to talk to anybody, I'm to scared of fucking up relationships to even build them, I'm so fed up with all of it. I really wanna kill myself, but just like so many other things in life I can't bring myself to follow through. I don't wanna live life like this anymore, but I'm powerless to stop it. No matter how hard I try to pick myself up I fall down harder every time. So I can't do it anymore, today could be my last day, and I hope it is.",suicide

I've had thousands of dollars in savings from years of working, but I recently left that work to finally go to college. I got to take a program that was free. It's a general program that allows you to spend a year on basic courses, and get your life back on track, if you have some mental health issue, or other such qualifications. Among 2 occasions in my past where I've been talked down from a ledge by the cops, and thrown in the hospital, I have struggled with substance use, so I qualified. It was 3 semesters. I spent the first semester doing well for myself. The coursework is pretty light by college standards, but straight A's are straight A's. . All hell broke loose a few months ago though,  when the unionized staff of the college went on strike. I spent a month having a lot of free time, and I relapsed. I came back to school unable to reengage. I showed up to class drunk on several occasions, and some of these occasions went noticed by the staff. Since it's a recovery based program, they were patient and supportive about it. They were more patient than I deserved, but a time came when I finally pushed my luck too far. I had an incident where I recklessly took a handful of Adderall, and then had a liter of vodka immediately after that. I collapsed, and was taken to the nursing station to wait for it to ware off. my teacher left me there at noon to sleep, and went to teach her class. She spent 3 hours teaching her class, and then came back to check on me. I was still asleep, and wouldn't wake up even with the nurse yelling out my name, and trying to pinch me. Then I pissed myself, and still didn't wake up. It was determined that I had a problem with dehydration, and I needed immediate medical attention or my life was at risk, so an ambulance was called, and I was taken to the hospital for the night. . . a few days later I had a meeting with my teacher about what happened. They have not axed my from the program, but they have told me that I need to step away and regroup, before perhaps coming back next semester. I'm not mad at them for their decision. They've been great to me for months, and I don't want to be too much of a problem for them, but this has been a bad situation for me.. . I've isolated myself. I just lie around in the basement now. I spend hours a day in bed just enjoying the comfort of my bed. I try to enjoy other things like watching movies, and basketball games, but those things don't feel like enough of a reason to live. The only way that they satisfy me is if I enjoy some beer while watching them. Beer adds to the experience, because it's tasty, and I've made a strong association between beer and basketball games. without beer the experience isn't compelling enough to me, and feels incomplete. If I'm short on beer, then I don't enjoy doing things in the basement enough, and if I don't enjoy those things, then I don't enjoy anything. I only have so much in savings, and between the money that I spend on alcohol, and the rent that I pay my dad, I'm going to run out of money before long. I'll have no funds to drink beer, so the basement won't be good enough anymore. I'll have to go out into the world, but I don't want to go out into the world, because I've become accustomed to isolating myself, and I've given up on everything. Some people close to me have followed my lead, and are pessimistic about me too, so I feel like my hopelessness is being reaffirmed. . . I have a bottle of Adderall, and a liter of vodka, and I'm thinking about taking a handful, and downing it with vodka again, only I'll take even more of both, to hit myself even harder. This time, i'll be alone in the basement, and nobody will be around to save me, or even notice that I'm gone for a few days. it would be pretty painless compared to other things I could do, because i'd pass out, and then probably die in my sleep. There's no painless way to die, but that would be better than most, and I feel like I'm going to do it when I run out of money. . . ",suicide

"Today I may kill myself.Some background: I'm 22 years old, in college. I've had depression pretty much my whole life, but didn't get diagnosed until I was 18. Spent two years in therapy before finally leaving home to continue college. Things were going well until I had a relapse last year. Everything started to spiral out of control and next thing I know I've been forced to move three times, failed to complete two semesters in a row and now failing just one month into this semester. My therapist put me on a waiting list for occupational therapy, but I won't be able to get any help for at least three months. I have an assignment due tomorrow, a midterm next week and I'm lonely. I have tried so many times to see the point in continuing but I feel I'm done. Nothing in life is enjoyable to me any more if it even was, I can't bear the thought of going back home (I hate my country with a passion). None of my friends have the time for me, and even the thought of my family doesn't take away the pain. For several years I kept myself alive because I didn't want to hurt my family, but I can't take it anymore. I don't care they'll be upset, it's not fair that I continue in this state just so they don't feel guilty. I can't bring myself to tell anyone about any of this, so I'm leaving this here so someone will know have read my thoughts. I'm currently expecting a call from my therapist, and depending on how that goes I'm going to summon up what energy I have to end my life.. . Currently lying in bed thinking about my options. I have paring knife in the kitchen I plan to use. I live alone so no one will know to come for me (until my landlord comes to pick up the rent). My other option if I can't overcome my fear of how much cutting will hurt is to take a bus downtown and jump off a bridge there. . . Update: My therapist called an hour ago. I'll be seeing her tomorrow, and she's trying to get another psychiatric evaluation for me.",suicide

"Here's how and why I'm gonna kill myself over money . . It's just that even if I magically got over depression, ptsd, panic disorder, anxiety, and psychosis my life would still be fucked up beyond repair. I'm tens and tens of thousands in debt and I'm only 22. It's been this way since I dropped out of college and then went to the hospital for a past suicide attempt. So now I have absolutely crushing debt from student loans, medical costs from the hospital, along with credit card debt because I'm an impulsive irresponsible idiot. My credit is sub-400 because so much of this has gone into collections and I haven't been able to keep up with payments. I eat on like $1 a day, have a cheap phone plan, a shitty car that needs so many repairs it could die at any second, live with abusive alcoholic parents because It's at least rent-free even though the abuse is intolerable, and work as much overtime as I can at the job I hate on top of giving plasma twice a week and it still isn't enough. By the time I make even 3/4 of my payments I have and pay for food and gas to get to work and back I have basically no money for anything including saving. That's working as much as I can and giving plasma and not a penny into savings and it still isn't enough, and other things just become more and more delinquent in collections so my credit only gets worse and worse. Some of these things I'm only even making interest payments so I'm literally making no progress whatsoever on the actual debt.. . I can't move out of my abusive, disgusting house (pet waste, pests and mold *everywhere*) with parents who are drunk 7 days a week 52 weeks a year. Even working my absolute hardest at a job that I hate but the pay is ok and I can work overtime and plasma isn't enough. I can do literally nothing.. . Even if I weren't depressed this would be a horrible horrible existence and that's the thing people don't get. It's not even about the mental illness anymore. Yes I'm taking meds and seeing a therapist and psychiatrist and have for 7 years but none of it has ever done a thing. I've done the works, every lifestyle change and med and therapist and group and therapy type and everything short of ECT or ketamine because I can't afford them and none of it has ever done a thing.. . But! Even if it did, even if i was mentally healthy, my life would be absolutely awful. I can't live like this. I don't think anyone should. If someone described this life to me even if they didn't have a diagnosed mental illness I'd understand if they didn't wanna live. This isn't unreasonable or crazy. It isn't ""just money."" Money *does* buy happiness for some people and I'm one. I could move out from my horrible house, not work the shit job I hate and focus on doing things I enjoy and that heal me, I could afford more treatment options, I could travel, try to get back on track to going to college again, I could visit the couple friends I have who live far away etc. It all comes down to money. That's it. My happiness is dependent on money and I can't get it and won't get it. This is realistically the best paying job i'll get right now and I'm working OT and supplementing my income and it can't even touch my needs. Even bankruptcy wouldn't help because a big majority of my debt is student loans.. . Just cruel. It's funny in the darkest way. Money is so arbitrary and it's what I'm gonna kill myself over. A social construct is gonna kill me. And if I had just had a better dice roll at birth I'd be completely fine. If I had just been born to rich parents like so many are I wouldn't have to die and could live a fulfilling life, but the way my life actually is I can't. It's impossible, I've tried everything. I've even very very seriously considered escaping my debt by moving to another country but it would be way too expensive upfront, even just a one-way plane ticket would be way too much. They say suicide is a last resort but it's like yeah obviously. Nobody stubs their toe or gets a hangnail and suddenly kills themselves over it with nothing else going on. I am using it as a last resort. I've tried literally everything else. Everything I can try, I tried and it didn't work. So this is all that's left.. .

"Should we change the definition of the word ""gay?"" Trigger warning ahead? Idk, depends on the way you think. . So recently I've found it inconvenient that one of the definitions of the word gay, ""to be foolish or stupid,"" was now considered an offensive definition, even though stupidity and homosexuality have nothing to do with each other. Of course, I can't do anything about it because I'm not gay.. . Now, I understand that finding this to be inconvenient is a very selfish concept. For example, if I said ""I support gay people"" and then later said ""the government is gay,"" my first statement is contradicted. Although I used the word in two completely different ways, the fact remains that I used the same word, implying that I think homosexuals are stupid.. . However, recently I found out about the origins of the word gay. Other than its oldest definition (to be happy and carefree), one of its earliest definitions was to be immoral and promiscious. Whether you were a prostitute or just a person who fucked a lot, you were called gay. Later on, when homosexuality began to appear more often, the term gay was then applied to homosexuals (it was still applied to prostitutes as well). Finally, the older definitions were removed, and the word briefly held the aforementioned definition ""to be foolish or stupid,"" before it was deemed offensive. . . In my opinion, I think it's strange to use a word with this kind of history on a supported minority. It's similar to the n-word: the mere action of saying it does not cause you to become racist, but it is still correlated with racism due to its history (although it's not like people used to say ""the government is a n****!"" back then). . I feel like a word with a history of negative connotations should remain with negative connotations, and a different word could be used in place of the word gay. Homosexual sounds a bit too scientific, so maybe ""lesbian?"" Idk, all I care about is knowing how you all feel about my opinion.. . Remember everyone, this is a very weak opinion that I have so it's very open to changes.

"(21 U.S male) I really need to leave. Too much trauma. I only have bad thoughts.To begin, I have C-PTSD.

I watched my mom pass away of an OD when I was 16. I spent 4 years in a horribly abusive relationship that was physical and emotional up until the end where my lack of libido caused occasional sexual abuse.

I turned and it was the girl taking off her shirt and exposing her breasts to me. She then ran and jumped and laid on me, still topless. I could feel her breasts against me. People laughed.. . I spoke up about it and was ostracized by that group of people and my ""friend"" harassed me and told me I was crazy and that I wasn't assaulted.

My great grandma was raped and murdered, my best friends - my brother Chad and my cousin Geoffery, are both gone. My brother was murdered, ran over by a guy after a fight on a farm road with no one else around and the guy was never charged. My cousin Geoff killed himself. My mom &amp; dad are depressed and barely holding on after losing their son. I tried having a baby, and it was the happiest I have ever been. Then she had a birth defect, her organs were outside of her body. I didn't want to have an abortion. I truly believed our family had enough tragedy and she would live. There was a chance. I went into labor at 7 months pregnant. I held my beautiful little girl in my arms and fell in love. Her lungs were too small. Doctors said she wouldn't survive. We pulled the breathing tubes out and I watched her asphyxiate to death.   . . I can't do it anymore. I feel so weak. My parents will die and my husband will die and I can't bear it. I don't want to be here for that. This world is horrible and cruel.   . . I am seeing a therapist and it seems to help a little but only the days I see her.

Ive tried dating but I dont enjoy sex nor do I have a sex drive which makes it difficult since its generally an important thing in a relationship so I ended giving up it just reminds me every time how truly broken I am.

"I'm not sure when, but I'm going to kill myself as soon as I can.Hey guys and girls, sorry to waste your time with my whinny bull shit, but as the title states, I'm in a bit of a mental pickle. Okay, more like a mental shit storm. I'm sure my problems are stupid to anyone reading them, but then again, I never really expected anyone to read this anyway.. I've wasted enough of your time already, let me cut to the chase.... . For the past few years Ive had a developing case of depression. I was never diagnosed, but it's pretty obvious you're depressed when you feel like killing yourself will bring a bright day to anyone unfortunate enough to have met you. As time went on shit got worse and worse. To add on to my depression I was ""blessed"" with a rather...unappealing...guise. Basically, I'm ugly. Like, ape ugly. With acne. This, along with my depressing attitude, has lead to a non existent love life. Now, when I say non existent, I mean wont even be my friend, let alone my SO. Believe it or not, I envy those who get friend-zoned, at least they have something to go on. I have only been romantically involved with one girl, this went on for two weeks. During this time, I was cheated on and dumped. Great boost to my confidence, right? This kind of goes hand in hand with the fact that I have no friends. This is my own damn fault, because I isolate myself because I'm afraid that no one will accept me. To be fair, every attempt I have made toward making friends have ended horribly. I can't remember the last time someone and i have ever mutually considered each other friends. Well anyway, on top of that, I'm stupid. Really, really, painfully stupid. I can hardly read, I have difficulty processing things of little difficulty, I suck the big one when it comes to anything involving numbers, and I can't memorize anything to save my life. Being surrounded by normal kids makes me feel like I have a serious mental problem. The painful part is, I don't. If I did, then at least I would have some sort of excuse for not knowing anything, but I dont have one. Besides, kids with downs syndrome are actually doing better than I am. They not only get better grades than I do, but they are placed in higher classes while I struggle for D's in the low level classes. Just to give you some perspective of my stupidity. It just wrecks me inside because the world is slowly requiring more and more from the people academically, and I will be lucky to finish high school, let alone make it into a half decent college/university. But being stupid isn't the only reason for this, I also fear moving onto college because of the costs to go. My family can't afford it at all. We're definitely impoverished, literally everyday is a struggle to avoid foreclosure. Which leads me to another reason I want to kill myself, one less mouth to feed. I'll make sure my body stays in good shape after I do it and I will write a note saying that I want my body to be donated to science. This way, my family wont have to shell out a lot for a funeral, and for once in my life, I will be good for something, despite the fact that I wont be alive to see it. It would literally be my largest accomplishment if it worked out that way. At least someone would be able to benefit from my presence. I'm going to stop now, the more I write, the more I find wrong with myself, and the more I want to go through with it.. . Sorry again for wasting your time (assuming anyone read this). If it's any consolation, I wont be around much longer, so I'll get whats coming to me for wasting your time.. . Edit: ....Wow, thanks guys and girls, I haven't made up my mind yet but you all have really given me something to think about... I really didn't expect all of this, but it has really helped me keep on going for a little while longer, thanks again guys!",suicide

"*Update* - No plans. Only suicidal ideation. I need advice please.Hi, I forgot the password to my previous throwaway account. Here's the previous submission: http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/yjl00/no_plans_only_suicidal_ideation_i_need_advice/. . First some good news. My wife and I found a place, and she has a job. My father sent me $2000. So, financially I have some breathing room. . . However, my wife's job isn't great, and it doesn't even begin to cover the depth of debt she accumulated - let alone our living expenses. The place we got is small and cheap. But my money will run out quickly. . . I need to get a job, but I'm an American citizen living in Canada. My student visa expires in November, and the baby is due in December. I cannot work because I didn't graduate, I was kicked out of the master's program I was in. My degree is in philosophy, so it's not like that's of any help.. . My wife doesn't want to me to leave because she doesn't think she can handle being by herself in this situation. I'm not entirely sure what to do. . . Still things are okay now, but I see another huge storm coming my way. I don't know if I will be prepared for that. If anybody has any advice, I would gladly take it!",suicide
"I was going to kill myself todayI had everything planned. A note, a noose, some pills, and an empty house. I have been thinking about it for weeks and it just kinda feels like something I’m supposed to do. I am in a weird mental state somewhat akin to a nervous procrastination. I really feel like I should do it but I’m compulsively keeping busy with random chores. I’ve already done 4 loads of laundry today and I’ll probably do some more just to try to keep my mind from wandering. I feel so exhausted even though I got some surprisingly decent sleep but every time I sit still for a moment the thoughts go from a drizzle to a downpour. . . I really don’t want to go on. I am a burden and I hate myself. The only thing holding me back is my family and a good friend. I don’t want to hurt them but the pain is intolerable.

"ElegiaI think I’m going to kill myself tonight. It’s been something I’ve been wanting to do for years. My first attempt was at 10 years old, then I tried again at 13, then 14, then 15, then 16, then 18 and  19. The notes all written up and ready to go. . . The reasons are simple, I struggle with bipolar ii disorder, anxiety and feel depressed all the time. I also suffer from intense body dysmorphia which makes me starve myself on and off. Ive also been sexually assaulted twice, once when I was in middle school and the second time by my high school ex boyfriend who tried to fuck me while I was sleeping. Not to mention I’ve had multiple people in my family commit suicide. I even struggled with alcoholism at 13 because I thought that was the answer to my problems, but now I just have a gnarly little nicotine addiction. . . A good amount of time I feel like a burden and I know I’ve put my family, friends and romantic partners through a lot. And for that I feel absolutely awful. . . And you know what’s really shitty. I even OD this summer off benzos and woke up in the fucking hospital because I pussied out and drove myself to there so I didn’t die alone in my room. All that did for me was put me in a psych ward for the second time in less than a year. . . I thought that after my second time I’d have an appreciation for life, that I’d be happy to be alive but I’m still fucking miserable. And I have no idea why. I have a loving family, lots of caring friends (that know I’m bipolar and still love me and are always there for me), take meds that are supposed to stabilize me, go to therapy, have a good job where I work with really cool people, and good grades. But I’m still miserable and tired of living. . . I wanna take a bunch of benzos again because I feel like ODing will be less painful and as weird as it sounds I liked ODing. I was so at peace when I was benzo’d out and it’s the only method that I have access to (don’t own a rope, don’t have a gun since I legally can’t own one and I’m in the suburbs so no tall buildings I can fling myself off of). In a perfect world I’d OD off heroin or fentanyl because I’ve always wanted to feel that high (but not live with addiction that follows). I think I’ll do it outside my house so my family won’t have to find me in my room. . . The only thing I feel really shitty about is that if I die my dog won’t know why I never came home.",suicide
"I know that things will get better, and I don't want to end my life, but I can't stop thinking about how convenient it would be if my life would just end. I don't know what to doI kind of feel selfish for posting this, because I know that lots of people have it much worse than me. I'm not exactly sad, but I'm not happy. Come to think of it, I don't even remember the last time I felt anything. . . I'm 22, and I know that these feelings are common for my age. I know that statistically speaking, it gets a lot better, but how long am I going to wait? I live a constant lie, and I don't know how to get support from anyone. . . . I've never been in a relationship, as I'm a gay closeted man, nobody knows about it, not even my closest friends. I know that it is naive to consider ending my life over such a petty excuse, but it really really sucks, and I feel like I've bottled so many things over my life, that there are far more problems than just coming out. I have to lie about so many things, hide my true emotions and keep a shit ton of thoughts to myself. I've been doing this for so long that I now actively avoid people, because that's what I've done all my life to hide who I really am. . . A few times over the past few years, I got close to some guys. We would chat online, get to know each other more, but the more I expose myself, the more I feel like I need to cut ties and run away. It always ended in me freaking out and distancing myself from anyone who got too close. . . I look at the few friends that I have, and I know that they're not really my friends, as they would all severe ties if I ever came out. My parents would disown my and kick me out, and I would devastate my backwards arab family, because they expect so much of me. The idea of the future that I have for myself would be worse than cancer to them. . . I now live in Canada, where it is much more open and accepting, and I actually feel a lot more comfortable, but nothing really changed. I've been here for five years, and I barely made a friend or two. I still live the same lie, I still avoid people. Nothing changed at all. . . I suffer from mild social anxiety (as diagnosed by my school psychiatrist), and I find that making new friends or talking to strangers one of the most daunting tasks ever. The idea of coming out to anyone is absolutely terrifying, and I'm not even considering it. I grew up in a very homophobic middle eastern country where I was bullied and beaten by classmates and adults for being a feminine child. I've always liked playing with my sister's barbies, putting a towel on my head and pretending I have long hair, hanging out with the girls during recess, and all of those things were absolutely forbidden. I was bullied by the boys in my school for not liking sports and for not acting like them. I never really belonged to any group in school, and I isolated myself to try and avoid getting hurt. I grew up getting taught to be a man, to stop being a pussy, to hide who I really am and put on a macho facade. Now I'm 22, and I don't know how to engage with humans. I wish I could be happy like a normal person. . . . I want to just disappear. To never see anyone in my life ever again. Fuck everything about living like this. . . . . ",suicide

I do my very best to make sure that she is taken care of, and most importantly that she is happy. Unfortunately, keeping her happy can be like a chore sometimes. She has had her heart broken so many times by inconsiderate scumbags, and I'm truly lucky that she even had enough trust to let me into her life and get to know what an amazing and beautiful person she is. I love her with all my heart, but she hates herself; the kind of loathing that you would have for an arch nemesis, but that enemy is herself.. . She does have her moments of confidence, but that is few and far between. Sometimes she gets so bad that she becomes unresponsive to anything I have to tell her. I've tried everything a regular person such as myself knows how to do. She doesn't respond the same way to advice that I do. I like to talk things through, reason, and rationalize problems to have a better understanding of how to resolve them. She's very emotional and empathetic, and just wants to be held when she's upset.

"How do I tell my fiancé that I still feel suicidal?I’ve been dating my fiancé for 10 wonderful months. We met through a suicide/depression support chat. He has given me happiness, stability, unending love/understanding, and future goals (something I never thought I would have). He has truly changed my life. However, I have been passively or actively suicidal since I was 14. I have a genetic illness that affects my joints which makes everyday life painful and has limited my abilities. I used to be athletic, busy, and slim. Now I can barely walk and have gained weight, though I’m still skinny so really I shouldn’t be complaining. The worst part is that my illness has ripped my vet tech career right out of my hands just as I was really gaining traction and found my dream job in a ER/ICU. My career is my passion, it’s one of those “who I am” jobs. Not being physically able to do it has honestly devastated me. I go through phases where I’m ok, and phases where I feel like I’m mourning who I was and what could’ve been. My condition has gotten worse, I have been stuck at an intern-level position at my dream job (because I can physically do it and my employer has been AMAZING and worked with me to make sure I have income until I can go back to being on ICU floor). . . I have hit one of those bad phases. I want to self-destruct everything around me so that I won’t hurt anyone but myself.

Suicidal ideation has significantly lowered my anxietyI used to be crippling insecure and constantly worried about what others would think of me and judge me for whatever I say or do. The last couple of years I’ve been casually suicidal and at times on the brink of suicide. I’ve realized that whenever I find myself worrying too much about doing something in fear of being judged my mind immediately shifts to “I’m gonna kill myself soon anyway so fuck what anyone thinks” . . It’s strangely liberating to know that I can screw up or make a complete fool of myself and not have to worry about living with the shame and consequences . My life is in my hands and I can end it if shit gets too unbearable.,suicide
I don’t feel like there’s a point of living.I’m almost 21 years old and still lack all basic social awareness. All my coworkers hate me and I feel that I’m a huge burden on everyone I care about. I’m transgender and can’t afford to transition. The only reason I haven’t killed myself is because I don’t want to traumatize my family and boyfriend.,suicide
"How do I know if a girl likes me? I really like this girl in my class! I think se is very pretty and also really nice. I really want to get to know her better and maybe get into a relationship. How do I know if she likes me too? She has a lot of friends and also quite a lot of male friends so that makes it hard for me to know if she likes me as a friend or not. I try to talk to her as much as I can, but sometimes I’m a bit shy. I think she talks more to me than other boys in my class. Sorry for this long message lol. Thanks in advance for your advice!",non-suicide
"I'm (M18) contemplating suicide because of fucked up relationships.Hello, this is a smurf account. (ofcourse) Im a male at the age of 18, yes I am very young and this is a heavy subject. I know I have many years left and that stuff could be better in the future. Before I begin my message I should point out that Im not a native English speaker, but I'll do my best and I hope I do okay.. . . Lets dive into it, I really want to believe there's more to everything and I want help, I want a reason to live. I just don't know what to do anymore, or what to fight for. There's so much stuff happening in my life that I really don't know where to even begin, I realise that most of you on here is probably going through worse things that I do and this is silly as hell, especially when Im this young but its killing me, literally.... . . It began with my girlfriend of 3 years and 6 months breaking up with me, I loved her then and I still do. I would actually say I love her more than I love myself and I've always felt that way since the day I met her, the relationship ended on the 4th of March and everything changed in my life. I was a happy guy, had my interests, my friends and life was good. I didn't really have any suicide thoughts at all back then, I don't think that's ever been a thought. Anyways we kinda bounced back 3 months later and we're still at it, but its rocky as hell and I don't know what she truly wants or feels. We're pretty much together but she still says that she doesn't want to make it public and that she don't know what she feels even though she calls me baby, we both feel that its better than we ever had etc. I guess that's a short and simplified summary of the first problem.. . . The second thing I hold/held most precious in my life was my friends. Basically when my relationship ended I realised none of my friends really said anything to me, didn't ask how I was doing, what happened. Nothing, silence. I figured it was because they hadn't been in a relationship as serious as mine. I didn't talk much or do much with them for atleast a month if not longer because of my sadness, and when I got back in touch with them everything was different. I still don't know where I have any of them? They seriously haven't given two shits about my relationship ending or me feeling like shit. I even cried openly next to one of them and I know he saw it, didn't ask me or anything. They haven't asked me once how I feel, one of my closest friends even got mad at me for ""changing"" apparently???. . . The third reason are my parents. I've never been that close with my dad even though I live with my dad 100% of the time. He's pretty egoistical and he drinks a little bit to much. He doesn't care a lot about how things are holding up with me. He isn't mean or so, he's simply not that great of a dad and I don't have a strong connection with him. An example is that he asked like twice about the relationship thing and not much more, and when I come home from school he doesn't give many shits about what I did and how it went.. . . My mom and I are on bad terms, we used to be really close but she was diagnosed with (Don't know how to translate it) a disease that basically makes you tired all the time, which meant that she didn't work. It also meant that she often didn't cook me food, got angry at me for small things and when she felt that she didn't get her way she told me stuff like she would take her own life because of me, etc. I moved away from her and we begun having all sorts of fights after that. She broke a really important promise to me this summer and well everythings totally shit right now, I don't want to see her and when I do see her or talk to her she behaves like nothing has happened even though we had a big fallout and her boyfriend screamed that I will never be a part of their lifes etc etc.. . . Finally I feel like Im getting nowhere with my dreams, I really REALLY want(ed) to create video games. But I feel no passion. In anything. Its been 6 months. Me and the girlfriend are pretty much together again even though its rocky as hell, I don't feel happy doing anything at all except staying with her, Rick &amp; Morty or Game of Thrones isn't enjoyable, games doesn't do shit, drinking alocohol is only fun for so long, school makes me sad/tired and Im constantly tired sad and have frequent anxiety attacks. I have nightmares regulary because of the thoughts Im having.. . . Is suicide worth it? The obvious answer is fuck no, but please tell me what I should fight for? Please? I want to live reddit, I really do. But I don't know what I have in my life anymore. Its all gone to shit and I really don't give a fuck any longer.. . . tl;dr: Relationship with GF ended, friends didn't give two fucks, bad connection to parents and I don't feel like doing anything except sleep and cry. What should I do reddit?",suicide

"best way to commit suicide ?i’ve considered multiple ways but i’m not sure which would be the best one.. . i’m at home with my parents, i don’t have a drivers license since i’m not yet old enough to get one. there’s a forest near me as well as a train station if that helps. guns aren’t allowed in this country so i can’t use a gun :(. . i want to do it in a way so that there’s no risk of me staying alive.. . preferably something that happens as quick as possible but it’s okay if it doesn’t.. . so far i think hanging myself could be a good option but i don’t have rope.",suicide

So, I'm Egyptian, I live in Kuwait and there's that traditional Iranian bakery which is humble and you have to buy from the window but their bread is so delicious. And I went there and said 'Alsalamu alikum' which means 'may peace be upon you' it's a very friendly gesture and usually you must say 'you too' otherwise you're a duchebag. Anyways, there were two young men working there and one of them looked at me and didn't reply while the other was busy, he took the money and was preparing the bread and his friend stared at me silently for a long time with a frown and his black beard and hair while he was lighting a match, it was so suspicious. The guy handed the bread over and I said thanks, again no reply from him. Then I just left and they didn't even say a word. I'm speechless.",non-suicide
The person I'm in love with lied to me.I started talking to this guy a few months ago and everything was going fine. We talk 24/7 and we even started planning to meet up. He told me that he was 25 but turns out he was lying about his age the whole time and he is actually 17 (almost 18). I've always been honest with him about everything and it hurts so much to know that he lied to me for months.. I just feel like I can't trust him anymore. He was the only person I trusted. I feel betrayed. . . I told him that it's not a big deal and I still wanna meet up but my suicide thoughts got worse and I'm just sad all day. I know it would hurt him so much if I kill myself so I can't do this to him.,suicide

"Living for my little sisterHonestly my life is a complete joke. I am a complete failure and a joke and I have no motivation or interest in living in this fake society humans have made and deemed normal. I just can’t.

I could not imagine the pain and suffering I would put her through if one day someone has to inform her that I’m gone and never coming back. Maybe one day things will change so I can finally stop living in this absolute mess of a world and my miserable existence can end.

"I think this might be last thing I typeI was born in extreme poverty. How extreme? At point of time , My father and his siblings had to gather wheat grains fallen while transporting them for food. But when I was born , my father was working hard to give me two times a day food with help of my mother.. . Growing up I was a unruly boy. I was all over place. Screaming &amp; attacking etc doing all crazy sort of things. Because of lack of education, my parents didn't knew any better nor they could afford any of my medical expenses. Since they thought I was just being general asshole , they started punishing me physically. My mother has put powdered chilly in my eyes and throat countless times this continued until 13 . On other side,  my school started to get more shitty , As there were lots of bullies that bullied me. At age of 15 , I tried to commit suicide, I tried to jump off of my school building. Also what contributed is death of paternal grandparents , my maternal grandfather and my paternal uncle. They were really close to me, and until that point they were the only people that  gave me nice things like toys , A $1 toy was fortune for me.. . Later, well into adulthood, I found out that I have ADHD , and because of my past, I have sever depression, anxiety &amp; PTSD.. . But My father and mother worked hard none the less and put me and my younger brother through engineering college ( I took 10 years for 4 years school). Now I work as engineer, and because all of mental issues, I have no one.But I had friend tho , she went through bad child hood experience has child hood as I did. She lives half way across the world. I used to talk to her daily. But she is now busy in school and word and don't have time to talk to me.. . Now , I am 30 . I   have no friends , I live in decent house but no one is here except me . I have no one that loves me anymore . I don't talk to anyone. I go to work 9 come back at 6, and that is it. I have no one who loves me anymore , no one. And because of my anxiety I can't get into dating scene . . I have long thought about this over several times , I keep asking myself a question what I have to give to this world. I have nothing, Nothing.. . So Yesterday , I got some potassium cyanide from work. I might try to off myself in couple of days. I have taken sick leave for couple of days .

"I did a prank on my parents So, basically, I made a fake gmail account of my online school teacher, and I sent this email to both my mom and dad, and the gist of it was basically I was not paying attention in class and that I was distracted. I sent it and then I could hear my dad reading it out to my mom because for whatever reason he got the email first. This prank was gonna be extra spicy because we're an asian family, of course they're gonna go ballistic. So my dad called me into his room, and I just couldn't stop laughing, so I spilled the tea and they seemed pretty worried still. They said because I opened a fake email in my teachers name, something that can be a crime. Now, I'm not sure if it's a crime but I did make sure to delete the email account.

"I don't have a reasonSince I was kid I loved football, I was probably the happiest person on the planet just with the ball. The time flew and life was pretty much beautiful, because football was the way for me to forget the world, forget all the problems. . . Later in high-school, I was diagnosed with tumor in my knee, had to stop doing all activities. Slowly stopped talking to people, kept everything in me, gained few pounds, started to hate the world, why me. . . My life became just gaming for few years, sure there were attempts on girls, but I've been so lucky that first I fell for moved to Paris, 2nd moved to Canada. (I'm from Slovakia) The another attempt broke me so hard, that I wasn't talking to anyone anymore. Then something happened with my skin, had terrible acne for maybe another 3 years, trying to get rid of it any way, but it just didn't work out. . . I've been so done with my life, thinking about why should I even live? What's next for me? What's the point, cut connection with ""friends"" who only needed me when they wanted something, but if I wanted something they disappeared like ghosts.. . Finished high school, started Uni, it felt good for a while. But my acne got even worse, I was afraid of going into public, I was scared of what are other people thinking. I tried fucking everything to get rid of it. Can't invite that beautiful girl out with that ugly acne scarface, can't go out without everyone looking and pointing at you. So I stayed home, forgot all the social life, got a little job while studying so I won't have to think about all the bullshit.. . After 4 years, and probably millionth attempt of getting rid of it, I saw it's getting better, even if the pills caused depression(even bigger than I had) I was getting happier cos it was looking good. Around 3 months later that semester, we had this group project where we were 3 boys and 1 girl, I barely knew her, cos she arrived to our class just this semester. I didn't think much but after talking about this project we kept kinda longer and it was really nice feeling. Later that day she texted me she have to see me tomorrow asap. She got me, 3 years older, beautiful girl, which I couldn't even imagine wanted to see me.. . Next almost 3 months were so beautiful, we were going for trips all around, getting to know each other, everything looked so good. I started to gain confidence, after maybe 7 years? I started to visit gym, started to love running again, everything looked so perfect.. . Then, I bought her roses, she made the dinner, we had beautiful night, and very next day she simply didn't even wanted to talk, write or anything. And since we had this ""family sharing"" where you can see each other location anytime (it was her idea), I checked it randomly and she was with her ex. Who she was cursing probably whole time, how the hell she even was able to be with him, how she can't stand him even 1 minute when she wanted to pack he things and so on.. . Things escalated and work got full of rage, people screaming at each other, school became unbearable, literally everything went downhill after that. . . I can't focus anymore, she was the reason, I tried to look at everything from the lighter side. To say, fuck all the bad, and focus on her, because she made me smile, she was the only person who said to me I love you, after 23 years I though I found someone, who actually cares. . . But it was probably just a game, I wake up early at 4AM thinking about why? I usually wake up at 6AM going for an early run saying it will be nice day. Now I can't. I try to run, I quit. I don't see happiness in it anymore. I don't see happiness in anything. Tried gym again, tried everything I loved, games, films, nothing works now. She gave me hope and she took it away. . . I've got my papers ready, I'm ready to end all of this, I've been thinking about suicide(really close to it) twice in my life, somehow I made kept going. But I'm not so strong this time, I just don't have a reason anymore, don't have a will to breath.",suicide

I've struggled with depression my entire life. Not the ""can't get out of bed, low energy"" kind of depression but the ""I just ran up a mountain and I should feel good but all I want to do is jump off"" type. My highs are \*always\* followed by even deeper lows. I've tried meds, several kinds and dosages. Meds are like Lake Missoula for me; they hold a lot of stuff back but eventually it breaks and all the growth is wiped out. . . &amp;#x200B;. . I thought losing over a 140 lbs would make me happy. It didn't. I thought becoming a long distance trail runner and becoming a mountain guide would make me happy. It didn't. I thought getting out of tech and working with people would make me happy. It didn't. I thought being a sport camera operator would make me happy. It didn't. . . &amp;#x200B;. . Despite all my best efforts I am not a good person and I've struggled with this my entire life. I have bad thoughts constantly but I don't act on them. This causes me a lot of guilt. It's crippling. I've never seen a future for myself and it's why I never finished college, despite being intelligent and curious. I think in the short term because honestly I've always thought I'd kill myself. I've been sure of it since I was a pre-teen. . . &amp;#x200B;. . So I came up with a plan. I'm going to donate my kidney first, then a part of my liver. I've been growing my hair out for over a a year and I'll be donating that as well(if possible, I know it can be selective). I'm a registered organ donor as well and I'll be committing suicide in a manner that will my major organs in good condition. The kidney donation is already setup and I'll be flying out there in a few weeks. I don't know the recipient. Really I don't want to meet him. I've had his phone number for a month and I've yet to reach out to him. . . &amp;#x200B;. . I can't tell anyone in my life about this for obvious reasons.

"I cannot save you.Every day is the same. If you can even split the days anymore. I spend 2-3 days awake at a time. What little medication induced sleep I can suffer through sprinkled throughout, like little pebbles in a huge field. But most of the time it's a solid nightmare. 45 minutes and you're awake again. Racked with sweat and fear, gripping your mind like a nut in a vise, slowly tightening. Light a cigarette, calm down. I can't. Just ignore it. I can't. Everything will be okay. No it won't. You don't live in the reality tangent that I do. You are all plugged into the matrix, living out your lives. Worried about bills, your children, you're worried about what these other people think of how you look, your clothes, your car, your social status. You don't know what true fear, anxiety, depression, angst, isolation and sadness are. . . My days are a hurricane maelstrom borne out of what must be hell. Sitting in that small room, 17 televisions around you on full blast 6 inches from your face, rapidly switching channels in a haze of static and color. Trying to solve the world's hardest math equation while you're in a straitjacket, hugging yourself close. Someone once said that is what it is like to be The Joker.

"Reaching My Breaking PointI've had diagnosed, Severe (my psychiatrist's words, not my own) depression for a long time, but things are finally reaching a breaking point. Everyday, it seems, is a living hell on earth. At School, my friends consistently ignore me and treat me like I'm an outsider, and only ever really talk to me if either A: I'm having an emotional breakdown, or B: None of their other friends are around. Other than that, they act like i'm not there, or, worse still, like I'm a painful nuisance. Worst of all, the one person who I used to talk to about this, the first person I told about my depression, is the worst offender, and every time I see her (which is often) I feel like a knife's being twisted in my stomach. My Romantic life is similar. I've never been kissed, never had a girlfriend, and every time I've asked someone out, I've been denied. HARD. School is painfully boring at best, and a torturous slog at worst. My grades are In the shitter (were talking low c's and d's from someone who, only last year, was a Straight A student), and, no matter how hard I try, I lack the drive or the ability to bring them up. Home life is just as bad. My family tries to help me, but none of them understand what depression is like, and act as if depression simply means I'm ""Sad."" And on top of this, I feel like I'm carrying a great weight on my shoulders. I lack the energy to do anything, and lack the drive and willpower to try to improve my lot. And the anti-depressants I'm on simply aren't doing a damn thing for me anymore. Abandoned and betrayed by my friends, misunderstood by my family, I'm cracking under the weight of being me. Simply going ""Fuck You"" and leaving to reinvent myself isn't an option. Waiting until high school is over and hoping for things to get better in college isn't an option. From where I'm standing, death seems to be the only way out. Back in September, I attempted to commit suicide, and failed. Next time, I'm sure that I won't be so lucky. ",suicide

"What to Say... Where to Start...I'm new to posting.  I'm not entirely certain what all I should share - I could ramble on about all that comes to mind, but I don't want to waste too much of your time...  Ah well, it's going to happen anyways, I'm sure.  Forgive the novel that will surely follow.... . Mind you, if you want anymore details, do ask.  . . Let's start with my general life, and whatnot.  I'm a relatively shy girl, keeping to myself and my classmates, and avoiding most contact with anyone who doesn't come up to me first.  I've grown up in a Christian household, was never purposefully sheltered, and have gone to the same small, private Christian school since Kindergarten - and I should be graduating from it this 2012.  I've never experienced much bullying of any sort, and even now the guys in my class don't pick on me because I don't appear bothered by their taunts.  -Fact is, I laugh at their sexist jokes, and even make my own.  I'm a tolerant person.  So, my years were relatively peaceful.  It's hard to recall, but I believe my self esteem was moderately good - I didn't think highly of myself, mayhaps, but I also didn't think negatively.  However.... . Come 10th grade, there was this new fellow in my class, joined the year before.  He was terribly pessimistic and unhappy...  He wanted to rid of his parents and siblings, held no love or care for them, wallowed in his sorrow...  He wasn't completely dark, he had a few happy moments, but the joy he had was undoubtedly short lived when he did have it.  Foolish me - I ended up crushing on him.  (Not because of his pessimism, though.). . This is the start of my first self-diagnosed depression.. . My theory is simple - I liked him, he was unhappy, I ended up unhappy because I hung around him.  My self-esteem collapsed - I'm ugly, I'm stupid, I'm nothing more than a shadow and stepping-stone for my friends, I'm not going to make it anywhere in life.  Every negative thought I had, I linked it to myself.  I sobbed over how no guy ever crushed on me, how even the guys in my class ignored me, how I felt unimportant and unloved...  And the one friend I confided in (solely over the internet about it, however; I hadn't the courage to say anything face-to-face or over the phone) ended up asking me to stop talking to her about it, because it hurt her.  Oh, that didn't help.... . For the next year, this sorrow became so bittersweet.  If I was ever happy, it was short-lived, while this despair and pain became my new joy.  I clung to it - it was all I understood anymore, all I was familiar with.  So with the pain came my joy.  I tore at myself, cried until I felt sick, begged God to help...  There was no release.  At this time, suicide was nothing more than a thought; I never considered it, it was simply a subject of pondering.. . Well, come summer vacation, I slowly recovered.  I had to MAKE myself let go of the depression since, as I've said, I came to cling to it.  But I understood that there was such a thing as happiness without the pain, and I, though alone now in my battle, overcame.  I no longer had the stress of school.  I cut myself off from the real world and was glued to the computer.  I made a few online friends, and continue to talk to them today.  They didn't at first know about the event, but they helped without knowing; simply talking, and having fun.... . I got better.  . For a while, anyhow.... . Two weeks ago, I felt a bit sad.  I supposed it was just going to be a normal, temporary sadness - everyone has those days.  But it soon occurred to me that it was lasting longer, and the feelings...  The feelings were all too familiar...  I was weak that day, I suppose.  I started to think of the future again, and get a bit stressed over school - It's hard to stay focused when you just want out.. . Nonetheless, so comes the second depression.. . I've felt more hopeless now than ever.  I don't see a future for myself...  I'm suffering again (though it's less addictive now than the past, it's still no easier to get out of).  I'm considering suicide now, not just pondering over it...  Though, even I admit that acting upon it is still probably a good bit of time away.  The consideration remains.... . The future is terrifying; I don't know what to expect from it.  It's not necessary to know how to survive the world when you're in school...  There's no classes or tests for that.  All you need is to memorize and repeat whatever the teacher says, and the things that are necessary to pass and graduate.  You don't need worldly smarts.. . Then again, most people are smart enough to figure it out, anyways.  I haven't such luxury...  I am an idiot, after all.. . How am I to survive in a world I know so little about?  I don't have my permit yet to drive - my own fault there.  I haven't had a job before, though I realize I should get one about now - but a lot of good, supportive jobs also require you to be a college graduate.  College is a new place, filled with strangers; If I go, I'll likely have no friend to ease me into it, and I quite dislike the idea of humiliating myself in front of everyone with my idiocy.  Considering I know so little, I'm bound to embarrass myself.  A place to live?  I'm a bit eager to get out of my parent's house, the freedom sounds pleasant, but...  That requires money.  Which requires a job.  . . The world is terrifying when you feel so confused, unable, and lost.. . My struggle to understand others' feelings...  I'm not completely oblivious - I can feel things towards others, and I can sort of understand what others feel (which isn't the same as predicting how they're feeling, mind you).  But when it comes to others' feelings towards MYSELF...  I don't get it.  Why do they care?  How am I not annoying?  Why do they want to be my friend?  What's so fun about ME?. . I lack the understanding.  I feel unloved, uncared for.  I feel alone.  This is probably what hurts the most...  I'm always so lonely.  I want to feel that love...  But it's so hard to feel.... . People say they view themselves doing certain things in the future.  I can't picture myself ANYWHERE.  This thought is frightening - what if it's foreshadowing?  What if it means I die young?  In one sense, the pain is over...  But I'm still not entirely prepared for it.  I'm not completely ready for death.... . I opened up to two (online) friends about my feelings some days ago.  Eventually, one created a video.  I heard the sadness in his voice, I saw his body language...  It suddenly occurred to me that they truly did care about me.  And it hurt to realize that I was hurting them with my stupid consideration...  No, I didn't -fully- understand the feeling towards myself, but it was a start.. . I can say that, thanks to that, I've considered it much less.  I do love my friends...  But I'm still so lost, so confused, so alone...  I still just want it all to be over.... . I want to get better for the sake of friends.. I guess this is the best reason.... . --. . Don't hand out ignorant, ""It'll get better"" comments.  Those don't help very much.  In fact, I guess most hopeful comments are simply repulsive...  So what's the point of my being here?  What help could anyone possibly offer.... . I'm sorry about my novel.  I'm sorry if I wasted time.  I'm sorry for my idiotic thoughts.  I'm sorry for... apologizing.  . . I guess I'm still hopeful that I'll still run into something that shocks me back to being sane.  But I also guess text isn't the best way to do this...  Words can be so cold, unfeeling, and unconnective.  I guess maybe I really should talk to someone - hear someone, see someone...  I guess that's what helped the most with that video.... . *sigh*  I'll shut up now.  I'm starting to ramble, and I've typed plenty...  Not even sure anyone will respond...  I hope it was at least entertaining to read this, if none else comes of it.  I hope it was all relevant and helpful...  . . ...and so begins my paranoid worrying.... (I get nervous and frightened I'm a bother). . Be honest.  If nothing else, I demand you be honest.. . Adieu for now -. but I will return.  ",suicide

"i want to die im scaredI've been depressed for years, been on antidepressants for years. I was on Prozac (Zoloft) for 2 years and have now been on venlafaxitine (vensir) for about 2 years. It doesn't work, nothing does. Life is just fucking pointless, I have a fiancee that I love so much but she deals with the same suicidal thoughts too. I don't want to see her do it before me, I want to do it first. I've fucked my brain up beyond repair, too many drugs that I started doing around age 12. My last few acid trips have been so so bad, I feel like I have felt what death feels like and its a relief. My last (and worst) acid trip left me embarrassed and ashamed and even though it was about a year ago I get flashbacks every fucking day. I can't go a day without either drinking until I blackout or other drugs. I was addicted to opiates (not IV though) for a long time and I was clean for 6 months until I went for an emergency operation at a hospital which they gave me morphine for which started the whole spiral off again. I can't do this and I don't want too. My biological family haven't spoken to me in years and just see me as a 'druggy'. Every councillor, therapist, psychologist or psychiatrist  I have ever seen has been pointless, and to be honest I find it hard to open myself up to strangers who simply do it for money, and I don't want to tell the truth because I am afraid of being put into a hospital against my will.

"I think I'm a threat to womenSince like five or six months ago I'm experiencing a terrible situation. I'm some kind of a lonely guy and I was about to graduate at university. I was finishing my thesis and I had a lot of free time. I became nostalgic about my friends that I had on a previous college I attended (I left because of depression) and somehow there was a girl whom I remembered, she was like my sister there and we are very good friends. Well I started to think about her differently, like I had a romantic interest on her. Years ago I became obsessed with a girl from my high school (Not the same girl I have currently interest with), to the point of basically stalking her (Something that causes me a lot of shame and guilt until today) after she rejected me, she was a friend but I was very ""in love"" (obsessed, in reality, but I thought that way when I was feeling that obsession) with her. I had outbursts of anger and once I had one with her (I didn't threaten her physically but I told her a lot of things one should'nt ever tell a woman). . . In the city where I live now for work I'm attending yoga, a gym, even a chef course in order to have my mind distracted, still I think I'm a serious threat to women because I believe that what happened in high school could happen to me with this girl or with another one in the future. I haven't told her about my interest because I fear a lot of my reaction to rejection. I think I could seriously kill myself, fall into depression or do some crazy thing if she rejects me, so I preferred to cut most of the contact. The strange thing is that I saw her some days ago and I somehow blocked my feelings, I didn't really think about how I felt about her. We greeted and talked and that was it. But if I start to think about her or another woman when I'm alone, I become very anxious and start to remember that incident from high school.. . I really love women and I want to read about feminism and all that stuff, because I think they deserve a life free of violence but I fear that once I am ""in love"" I could lose control of my emotions. It's a terrible feeling and I have suicidal ideations about that. I don't really think I will ever have a happy relationship (I'm virgin at 25, it's my fault, I'm not trying to gain sympathy on that).. . I don't know if today, or tomorrow or in the next 30 years. But I think that I could be a threat to women and I feel very bad about that. I somehow want to stop breathing before something bad happens. That's all I wanted to say.",suicide

"I'm lonely and unsure how to fix it.. This kind of turned into a rant... . . I am lonely. Since early high school I have found it near impossible to make friends. I escaped from this problem by not thinking ever; playing video-games all night and sleeping through school (literally, my parents even got me a cool pillow that fit in my pocket). After an existential crisis I deleted all the games from my computer and set out to conquer my shyness. It worked. I am no longer shy. However, shyness was not the problem. I simply have no idea how to interact with people. I took the same approach towards solving this problem as I did every other problem I've ever had. I looked it up on the internet. Unfortunately, I was unable to find much useful data online as almost all information was about how to make girls magically attracted to me without exercise in only 3 easy steps 100% of the time. I could not find any databases of conversations showing how to pick up friends, which would be much more useful to me than casual sex. . . I'm a junior in college now. I just got out of a two year co-dependent relationship. I have no idea how to establish emotional intimacy outside of a romantic relationship. I can maintain small talk for a decent period of time and do not come across as awkward as I imagine this post sounds, as I do not usually communicate directly from my thoughts. . . I have acquaintances with whom I get drunk and hang out occasionally, one really caring close friend who saw me crying and has been looking after me, and one close friend who used to be in love with my and I fear still is, making it irresponsible of me to seek his support. I spend most of my days trying to distract myself with logic puzzles, music, alcohol, or drugs. I hang out with people I know don't like me (they don't dislike me, they are nice people, they are just indifferent) because sitting in my room alone is depressing. . . I'm failing out of school because I have no motivation. I don't see why having a piece of paper that allows me to get a job I don't want will make me happy. Counseling has been utterly useless. When I tell her my problems she tells me I'm depressed and that I should take drugs that barely outperform placebo and arguably do not due to a bias in which studies are reported and the use of inert placebos. By this Friday I must decide whether I have the energy to pass my finals, as Friday is the last day I can take medical leave. . . I don't have much hope for the future. I have no idea how to make friends and am very lonely. I'm beginning to believe that perhaps it is not a lack of skills but an unchangeable part of my personality that keeps me isolated. . . How does one make friends? I have asked this question to people before an always get answers involving things I do not understand how to do. Just go talk to people. How? Join a club. I did, I did the club activities, the people there were not so incredibly impressed with my ability to listen to them talk that they invited me into their social circle. . . I am interested in math, technology, climbing things, mixed martial arts, building things, and can find just about anything interesting. It's not hard for an activity to compete with sitting in my room crying :p. . . I have always been exceptionally good at math. My perfect math scores and math team performance were most certainly the reason I was able to get into a good university despite putting almost no effort into my classes in high school, and my ability to get As in my math classes here without doing any homework and studying for a few hours before tests is the only reason I have not yet failed out. I feel like I might be happy with my life if I could somehow use this gift to benefit people who are suffering. When I try to think of a situation that would make me happy, being in a position where I help many people and I am irreplaceable seems to be the only one where I can justify my existence.. . I feel emotionally immature for my age. I'm not ready to graduate and take on life. I want to curl up in a ball and cry. I'm lonely. I wish I had friends. . .

"Feel's like I'm in a downward spiralI spent the entire time driving home thinking about what I want to say here, if anything. I'm still not sure exactly what to begin with, but here goes.. . I was never really an outgoing person, never had many friends. A few close ones, throughout my childhood, but they were the type of people that other people flocked to, the exact opposite of me.. . I had a few relationships throughout high school, most of which felt extremely codependent, using each other to fill a hole in each other that we both thought needed to be filled. The last of which lasted from my junior year of high school until my junior year of college.. . That last relationship was one that I thought would last forever, was the one I thought I was meant to be with for the rest of my life, a perfect fit. It turned out to be too good to be true. This relationship ended as my Junior year ended in college. She cheated on me.. . My self esteem and self confidence had never been very high. I had always been described as a decent-looking guy (in my eyes I was below average, even then), but after the relationship my self-esteem and self confidence were at a new found low.. . I'm one year out of college now, almost to the day. I haven't been able to establish another relationship since then. I've put on weight, and like I said have never been the handsomest guy, who would want to be in a relationship with me?. . I've moved back home with my parents since I got out of college. The few high school friends that I had around here moved on by now, and my best friend lives in an entirely different state and barely ever has time to talk. I feel alone.. . I got a job off an internship near my house, it pays way less then my degree would be able to get me and is very unfulfilling. But it gives me money without having to go through the intimidating stress inducing process that is interviewing. Why would anyone want to hire me to do a worthwhile job? My skills and resume are unimpressive, lackluster, to say the least.. . And she's having a baby with the guy she cheated on me with...I forgot to mention.. . I just feel like I have nothing going for me, I am unimpressive, unlikable, ugly. Everyone is moving forward with theirs lives, and I'm just standing still, getting sucked down into quicksand.. . I went to a doctor and she put me on Welbutrin. I felt like it was working for a while, but these last few days, anytime I think I want to cry. I try to distract myself, ignore my pain, my loneliness, with whatever I can. But I don't know how much longer I can do it.",suicide

Around 16 i stopped visiting him and now live permanently with my mom, but my whole life I've struggled with chronic mental health issues as a result of what I went through. Now covid has been going on for nearly a year now and I've had all of my college applications denied, my fafsa isn't being accepted, I can't get a job (my mom won't let me leave the house) and my two partners who I adore are thinking of breaking up with me because of the effects of constantly having a distanced relationship on their own mental health. I feel like I'm hurting everyone I love and turning into my dad, the exact person I didn't want to become. Even after years of therapy nothing seems to get better. For the past few weeks I've been tempted to just go in the shower and slit my wrists to bleed out, but I guess I'm still holding on for something. What am I supposed to do?

"My life story. Please read. I need help.I was born a meth baby. And I know this doesn't change who i am, but that does mean that I was taken away from my mom and put into Foster care where I met my Yai Yai (grandma) she originally took me in, but my mom claims she ""fell in love with me the moment she saw me"". . Now I have a lot of issues, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder. That's only a couple. . . So my mom adopted me. It was just me and her, shes had some boyfriends, but I haven't met half of them and the other half never stick around, so I learned not to grow attached to them.. . My mom and I, well you can say we clash heads alot. And by alot I mean, at least once a day. I am overweight, and she constantly makes comments about what I eat, even though we never have junk food in the house. She always keeps it in her room. "" Are you really gonna eat that?"" And "" you shouldn't put that in your body, you'll just get bigger."" Are phrases I hear often. I feel like im disappointing her every time I eat anything. It makes me want to never eat again, because I feel so guilty.. . My mom and I also fight about other things. And when we do, it sure gets ugly. We call each other names like bitch and tell the other that we hate them. We scream and I cry and that just makes her angrier.. . Anyways, she got her new boyfriend. Well, not new now, but anyways, she got him about 3 1/2 years ago. They fell in love with each other. And he lived in a little cabin in the middle of nowhere.

Eventually he moved in with us, but it was bad.. . He would sneer at me and would laugh when I cried. He took my mom away from me. They always locked themselves in there bedroom, away from me, sometimes for nights at a time. . He invaded my life. He forces hugs on me when I'm not comfortable. And he calls me a bitch. And to shut the fuck up. We have screaming matches and when I tell my mom all the hurtful things he says, she takes his side and says it was my fault.. . We moved to a bigger town all together recently, and he hits my cat. My mom of course does nothing because, she hates animals. And when I try to talk to her about it she just rolls her eyes and says my cat deserved it. . . I'm home alone all the time 6 days a week, from 6:00 am to 7:00 pm.

It's so hard to explain, it just stays there in the back of my head and never goes away. . . I'm going to be completely honest with myself. This summer I haven't done anything really. I've been wasting it by staying in my room, isolated. I don't have any hobbies, I don't have any ""real"" friends (none of them text me anyways or ask if they want to hang). We don't really have anything in common, I've been hanging out with them for years but we've been slowing losing our friendship because of my disorder. It really takes away everything.. . In grade 7, my anxiety and depression was so bad that I missed tons of school (almost half the school year). The anxiety and getting out of bed from depression was that bad. The guidance counsellor had to get involed to ask me what's wrong but I said that ""everything is fine"". (It wasn't). My mom was even wondering what was wrong with me and she asked me if I had depression (she asked me before as well) and I just said no. I don't know why, but I just didn't say anything.

This year there is this amusement park that comes here every year and everyone goes there for fun and entertainment and I want to go. For the past 3 years I didn't go. My family goes there every year and they ask every time if I want to go but I just say no. I beat myself up everytime and just stay home while everyone is having fun.

"I can finally be honest. I'm not afraid of death. I posted here about four months ago saying I was planning on killing myself with carbon monoxide poisoning in my car. You can check it out [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/h6icx/i_plan_to_kill_myself_this_friday_with_carbon/). . . What stopped me was a moment of weakness when I revealed to a friend my feelings and suggested that I had some sort of plan. Understandably, he freaked out, called my therapist, she called campus administrators (she told me that's the law when a student professes suicidal ideation), and my friend accompanied me to the hospital's mental ward where I experienced nothing whatsoever that has helped me. I was bored, read Carl Sagan, imagined all the questions the doctor was going to ask me, and prepared answers that would get me out of there as fast as possible. It worked, and he saw nothing wrong with me. . . Fast forward to today (found out my carbon monoxide plan wouldn't work, but found a popular book detailing easy and painless suicide) where I have all the tools required to kill myself. I could set it up in five minutes and be dead in twenty. That is all I've been fantasizing about for the past four months. That last breath I'd take before losing consciousness, the ""tunnel of light,"" the letters I would write (I'm planning on writing one suicide letter to everyone and smaller letters to those closest to me), my funeral, etc. etc. as well as the purpose of the universe. I've watched movies like Sunshine, The Road, The Loved Ones, The Secret Life of Chaos, etc. trying to find some emotion that would stop me from doing it. I've talked to so many people about it (two therapists in person, online chat, friends who have experienced depression and attempted suicide, read all the suicide prevention articles online; read many, many responses on reddit by people giving eloquent and beautiful responses to suicidal thoughts) and it just doesn't seem to work. Any response that someone gives has a momentary effect of clarity, but my mind always finds a way around it. The topic of suicide is almost completely emotional and if someone uses emotional appeal, it's like a ripple hitting a dam. . . Logically, I see no reason for life. I can't make up my own reason because I'm a stupid, stupid human that is never going to know what is ""really going on"" and distracting myself with happiness on the off-chance that we'll figure it out one day feels hopeless. Every single day is met with more ways to be cynical. The more people there are, the more stupidity breeds (myself included). . . After pondering why my mind works this way for such a long time, I'm afraid it was due to my religious upbringing. When I was a child, hearing that there was a heaven was reassuring because I didn't have to worry about the universe. I didn't have to worry about anything because the bible had worked it all out and I just had to be a good person to get an eternity. But, after having that fiction ingrained into me for so long, finding my own purpose feels impossible. At times, Irebel with reason against that “impossible feeling” by saying that religion is winning by allowing my childhood to psychologically damage me to the point of suicide. But, then I second-guess that logic and think that some part of me is genetically predisposed to suicide and religion has nothing to do with it. But, then I think about how I still don’t masturbate and am a virgin at 22 (which was solely due to my religious upbringing) and that logic makes sense again. Around and round it goes…. . I think there are two kinds of people: those who want to live forever and those who don't. Those that do want to live forever turn to religion, and those who don't just enjoy their life as best they can. They might start out religious but will eventually see the folly of it. But, what happens when those who want to live forever can't turn to religion and are face-to-face with the thought of nothingness? I learn a lot from movies and the first thing that comes to mind is the end of “Death Becomes Her” where Bruce Willis' character has just died and the pastor at the funeral states that ""he will live forever through the lives of his children and his children's children"" or something along those lines. But, entropy is inescapable. It might be an entertaining thought to live forever through the life you have now, but life is like light approaching a black hole. It might seem like you are going to travel forever, but eventually you, those you know, the good you've done will be erased from memory and existence. It almost feels like my mind is currently that light, but it's circling a black hole. The pull of it is so monstrously strong that it feels pointless to fight back. I guess my question is... is there some way to pull away from the black hole, to truly live forever? Because to fight death and make your legacy last as long as possible seems mind-bogglingly pointless since we are all going to end up in the exact same place. . . Do I condone others committing suicide? Of course not. There is a student who lives across from me who has cystic fibrosis, takes dozes of medications, and told me that his life expectancy is 30. Still, he is studying film and video editing. He says that his outlook on life is ""Don't care what people think of me, don't take anything too seriously."" I envy him immensely and think it is fucking awesome that he isn't letting his sickness get to him. Conversely, I'm a perfectly healthy (besides psychologically), friendly, intelligent and potentially successful guy with my whole life ahead of me. . . What the fuck is wrong with me? My lack of emotion? I'm far more emotional thinking about the effect this is going to have on my friends and family than the thought of dying. That's what I think most about. That, and what I could write that would help them realize no one was at fault but me. I don't want them to blame themselves or some ridiculous thing like atheism or weed. But, as much as I don't want them to feel emotional pain, the want for death is stronger. . . I don't know how I want you all to respond. I am hopeless emotionally and probably logically. I just want everyone to be happy.. . EDIT: Forgot to mention that taking medication is out of the question as well (for me anyway). To begin to take medication would avoid the problem. I don't want a pill to make me happy. I want the truth of the universe to do that. But, the truth and universe were not created to make humans happy, so that's probably asking for too much. . . EDIT: I'm going to delete this because I'm afraid a friend is going to find out and tell everyone. Not sure if it saves the thread, but I can't risk him finding out. ",suicide
"I don't think things can continue like this.If the next 30 years are like the last 30, I am positive I don't want to experience them. I don't know if I could do it, but I have the means, sitting in front of me presently, and I can't quite get my mind off it. I can distract myself for a few days at a time, and try to be cheery when around people, but I consistently come back to this state of mind when the weight of my loneliness comes crashing down on me. I sincerely believe that a life without love is a life not worth living, and I am faced daily with the realization that it is almost certain that I will die alone. I maybe wouldn't want to slog through an extra several decades to come to the same end.",suicide

"Dont think I was meant to be a mom, maybe I'll kill myself insteadSince having my baby in January I've been increasingly depressed, angry, and anxious. I know its probably PPD and PPA but to be fucking honest, I dont care WHAT it is. All I know is I want it to stop. I dont enjoy being a mother. I got pregnant at 19. Just recently had my 21st bday. So I'm a young mom. I kept the baby because I thought I was going to be a good mom. I've worked at daycares. I've always been good w kids. I always wanted to be a mother. And I LOVE my baby, with all my heart, but I'm just not a good mom. I hate not being able to do anything anymore. Always broke. Cant even shit on my own time. I dont sleep. My baby is 9 mo old and still wakes up up to 8 times a night. I dont like my appearance. I don't like sitting home all day. I dont like the sound of my baby crying. I don't like changing 10000 diapers a day. I don't like not being able to do ANYTHING when I want to. I miss independence. Freedom. Having a personality other than tired and stressed. Friends. Going out. Relaxing. Having goals and hopes for my future. Lmao, all the goals I had are gone now. Cant go to college when all your money is being spent on formula. Cant go to college when you dont have a babysitter. Cant get a good job without college. Etc etc etc. I'll amount to nothing more than a mother now. And for some people that's enough. But I feel like I may as well be 50 already, just say bye to any semblance of youth i have. I don't think its right to my daughter to have a mom who doesnt wanna be here. I don't think it's fair to my boyfriend to have to deal with me. I will NEVER be happy away from her so leaving and starting over isnt an option. Cant undo my baby in my brain. But I will never be happy doing this either. I just want to quit. I want to die. I want her to have a better mom. I want her to not see anger from her mother. I want to not be conscious or aware anymore. I want to cease to be. But I'm terrified I'll do it and get stuck on the other side watching her from afar. If I knew 100 percent death meant emptiness and conciousness death, I'd have done it long before now. And I've struggled w depression, bi polar, borderline personality, my whole life. I don't see it getting better. Just worse. So why stick around?",suicide

"Do I have a face?Slightly graphic, but imaginary things below. Do I have a face? Nobody even looks at me when I cry (to be fair silently) sitting in the middle of a class. I'm always either terrified to death about everything or bored to death about everything.. . . A few weeks ago, I've started getting paranoid about... not having a face. Yeah. Really. There are just moments where I feel like my face has been cut off at an angle, and like I could touch (I'll remove this part because it's kinda sick). When I get that feeling, I put my hand below my chin and slowly inch it up towards the 'missing' part of my face - but it's been right there every time so far. You could say I'm scared of 'losing face'. Har dee har har. I'd like to ask people around me if I have a face when I have the suspicion, but it would be weird and later I realize it's unnecessary because they would scream and run if my face wasn't there anyway. But I go back to thinking that again and again and it even slipped past once or twice. They were surprisingly calm about it, and told me that I do. It was nice.. . . I was looking at an unreflecting window, and I could feel my face has gone missing again, so I... in retrospect this is really weird, don't judge, I ran right into it and tried to stick the flat, cut part of my face onto the surface so it would attach itself to the window, like a suction cup. I started screaming loudly and sobbing afterwards, but I stopped and calmed down because I have the habit of remembering that everyone looks like shit when they cry whenever I want to cry, letting me shed a single tear without a single line on my face and leaving it at that(it's fucking weird now that I think of it but I forget what upset me immediately after when I do that. It's good for me). I just carried on with my life after that.. . . I sometimes see short, random, somewhat disturbing visions including and not limited to that face, a neat stack of cleanly severed limbs (it's my aesthetic), and this worst thing that I don't want to remember (and can't right now, so let's leave it at that). I flinch a little and it concerns my colleagues, but I'm really not that much bothered.. . . What was I saying? Oh yeah, being afraid that my face isn't there. So I'm making a mask that lets me show emotions because then it won't matter if I have a face, anymore. Something like Wrench's from Watch Dogs 2. I'm going to wear it all the way through college. Wish me luck.. . . I have a bad tendency of hurting myself when I feel angry at someone instead of letting it out in a healthy way. The level of violence has been slowly declining though and now I just sit, breathe, and try and identify why I'm angry. It doesn't help me quell the anger of course, but it helps me get less impulsive.. . . Okay. I've gone completely off-topic from the get-go, but posting on this sub has helped me once before, years ago, and it helped this time too even though I'm definitely much worse. Knowing someone probably reads it even if they don't comment or leave a mark because they can't find suitable words right away. Thank you, whoever made this sub.. . .  I hope I don't worry anyone and at the same time I hope I did. I'll try to seek professional help. I don't think I can really afford it but I'm sure I'll find someone who can help if I brave actually talking about it. I need to get this long suspicion that I'm on the autism spectrum verified anyway.. . . P.S. Vote up if I have a face. :'D",suicide

"I feel like I could just go downstairs now and ingest every med I can find, including my stepdad's cancer meds.Sorry, rant ahead:. . A couple of days ago, a close friend of mine attempted suicide, I haven't heard from her since. Of course during these past few days I've been feeling extra shitty since her and I felt similar things such as alienation and mediocrity. Due to my complete apathy to almost everything recently, my bedroom has become a mess, and not one of those messes that you generally see as a classic depression bedroom; I mean more like just I didn't have my bed made and there was a plate from lunch on my dresser. I don't think she noticed the bags of trash in the corner which are mostly filled with leftover alcohol containers. She just went so mad about the state of my room (normally I keep my door closed, half out of habit and half out of general shame) and she said she looked into my room to let one of the cats in: you don't need to turn a light on in my room to let a cat in, and quite soon after her lecture of sorts, I saw the aforementioned cat hanging out at the top of the stairs as she has been doing recently anyway. So most likely it was her just peering into my personal space. Annoyingly enough, today I actually cleaned a fair portion of my room as I've felt better today than the past few days: I cleared a tonne of old dishes out and organised the rubbish in my room a little better -- doesnt feel as if I can straight up just through three bags of trash into the bin because obviously thats noticeable. Either way, today I feel like I've been making tiny steps to get better and then just as I'm about to eat dinner, she swoops in and is like ""I never want to see that room in that fucking state again"" and whatnot. A large part of me wants to tell her that its either my apathy towards regimental cleanliness, or me collecting every single piece of medication in the house and just gulping it down alongside the red wine I have at the moment. Almost as if I can kill myself out of spite; my stepbrother has already been lost due to suicide, and my sister has suicidal ideation to the point where she's on disability welfare.

I really just need some affirmation that I have a chance to be successful in life. . . &amp;#x200B;. . Things going for me:. . I've been lifting almost daily since I was 13. . This summer, I worked 50+ hours a week as a 16-year-old which led me to purchasing my 1990 Corvette as a 16-year-old. Cars are my passion, and I realize lots of kids don't know their passion. For this, I feel very fortunate.. . I am very entrepreneurial. I like to buy and sell things to make a profit. I recently sold a 175 dollar purchase for 1000.. . I actively pursue to be better in every way at every moment. Do things to the best of my abilities. . . I don't get the best grades but I take AP classes. My cum. GPA is about 3.0. I plan to go to college for business.. . Does any of that mean anything? Can someone who isn't me gain any insight into what my future may look like just from what I've said?",non-suicide
"How long can someone really be expected to feel like this?First post here. I'm desperate. I don't want to die, but I can't live like this. I'm just so fucking tired of fighting. I'm tired of fighting to stay clean, fighting to stay healthy and happy. Lately, it seems like a fight just to get out of bed and be a human being. Is it selfish of me to want to die or is it selfish of everyone else to expect me to keep living like this? I feel like an old puzzle that has lost so many pieces over the years that there's no hope for a complete picture anymore. I just need to be thrown out. ",suicide

"""get help"" is a fucking joke.I've been in and out of inpatient care for about ten years of my life. It's been a long time since I've been out now (I'm 25 now, first went in when I was 12) and I'm finally seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist again.. . I have vivid hallucinations and PTSD. I'm scared of myself and my flawed perceptions. I've been seeing these new doctors for four months now and it's just.....bad. My new medication makes me even more suicidal than before. It's no longer 'passive ideation'. It's plotting and planning and hoarding my meds. It's eyeing scalpels on Amazon even though, hilariously, a portion of my purchase would benefit a suicide prevention institute in my hometown. I can text my psychiatrist when I have an 'issue', and when I told her I've been more suicidal since taking these meds, she told me that maybe she's not the right fit to talk about that, and redirected me to my therapist. He still hasn't answered. It's been a week.. . I feel this constant drive down, down towards death. I died once, for thirty-seven seconds, when I was in my late teens. Car accident. I was on my way to Disneyland with my friends and a drunk man drove us off the road. I was the only survivor. . . I'm sick of just surviving. I want to live.

"Help me breatheI decided to start writing here because I don't know where else to write. I don't really know what I'm looking for either. This isn't just a vent. I've been at the edge of suicide every day for a while now and reached a point where I almost drowned myself a few months ago.. . \[29M\] I've been somewhat of a reclusive since I was 18 which happened after I originally tried to kill myself. The thing with me is that I have a very obsessive sort-of mind and have always been very sensitive to what others feel. At the age of 7 I lost my best friend in a car accident and when I was 12 a close friend of mine confessed to me that she was being raped. I mention this because these sorts of painful things have always been a part of my life and have shaped who I am now. There's more than these two events, but I'm not going to share it all.. . I didn't know what to do, I was 12 after all, but she, with her family, moved away soon after and I never heard from her again. This marks a point where I changed more drastically and I spent my teen years getting to know others in a deeper and more genuine sort-of way. Eventually I found others who I felt needed saving. I somehow thought that if I could put the pieces back for others then I could fix things and the horrors of abuse and other things wouldn't need to leave their mark. It was immature and naive to say the least. I wanted to stop the suffering I saw and it made me want to understand it all the more. My mind became obsessive and I began having frequent nightmares over and over again of myself going through hell. I empathized with everyone that sometimes I didn't feel like myself anymore.. . I wasn't really able to save people though, it didn't work that way.. . I met a particular girl who fell in love with me and I began to care for her in a much deeper way than how I saw those I needed to save. It wasn't a good time to enter a relationship because I wasn't mentally stable, but I did. These new feelings, though, exacerbated the problem because not only did I want to help her overcome her trauma but I also wanted to protect her. These feelings of protections made me paranoid and I went through nightmares of seeing her going through all kinds of horrors. After 4 years, she broke up with me, and I never blamed her for it. . . It was then that I completely broke from reality and all I felt was pain. So, I tried to commit suicide and because it didn't work I went through physical torture for several hours afterwards. Being in the hospital didn't save me from the physical pain of all the pills I took because it was already too late to pump my stomach by the time I was there. Waves and waves of pain left me worst off. I secluded myself afterwards for 3 years because then I didn't want to know anything about anyone and didn't want to involve myself with the problems of others. I couldn't put the pieces back for anyone else and I only ended up shattering myself.. . At 21 I accidentally met another girl, a girl who needed saving, and I loved her smile. I had to get involved. In the end I thought I helped her because I went pretty far for her several times. This wasn't a normal relationship though because she was different. I didn't realize until some years later that she was just using me. I wasn't well just because I had found a relationship and while she didn't support me emotionally, I always felt that, that wasn't important because I had to be strong enough to hold everyone's pain. In many ways, that was enough for me. I did help her better herself to a degree but it eventually unraveled like anyone else, and our relationship ended. She changed more over time, cheated on me, and left me to pursue self-destructive behaviors like it was inevitable from the beginning.. . How she treated me hurt me and devastated me. My self-esteem went through the garbage and I began experiencing panic attacks along with constant severe anxiety. I wished to die several times and I couldn't function. I stopped eating until I couldn't move. I didn't want to kill myself because I love my younger siblings and I don't want to hurt them, but I didn't want to live either. I wanted to drown myself and I couldn't get the image out of my mind. Even my love for my siblings wasn't going to stop me but a stranger helped me ground myself before I could go through with it. . . I didn't want to just repeat what happened when I was 18 years old again. I decided to apply for a job in the middle of this pandemic and I got it. I've been pushing myself hard and I'm in college too, despite being 29, wanting to become a doctor because I'm still trying to save others. . . It's just.. every day feels like a painful current of electricity is running through my body. It's not the breakup that hurts anymore, I've made my peace with that, but I just feel forlorn. I don't really have friendships. I don't want a relationship although I get the feeling I won't ever have that opportunity again. Watching my family makes me so sad because we seem so torn apart. Poverty. My dog is probably going to die this year, he has health issues and he's old. . . I don't know what I need to feel normal. Writing this was more cathartic than I thought it would be, so I don't know if that has something to do with what I need. I don't understand why every day hurts so much. Why does it keep burning to be alive?  . . . If you made it this far then I thank you from the bottom of my heart and I hope some love comes your way.",suicide

"Going into the woods, ending it?I feel so hopeless about my situation. Overwhelmed by this life and dealing with people. Can someone help me see some sense in all of this?. . I am trying to give a background, a fair objective overview about my situation:. . I grew up in an abusive househould, my father was an alcoholic with anger issues...beat us and abused us. He tormented my family and it has given us emotional scars which will never heal, but we managed to escape after many years. My family (mother, two brothers) survived but communication is bad. We can't spend time together without fighting, I would describe our family dynamic as deeply dysfunctional. I am often the scapegoat (youngest person) in those conflicts.. . My childhood has made me into a bitter, moody and aggressive person. I spent many nights analyzing why I am like that. How i can change. I know I have anger issues and really tried to be mindful but I often snap and make people I love miserabel. They are not blameless, but I don't want to make excuses for myself.. . I am so tired of failing the people I love. They would be better off without me. I know they would be sad if I were gone, but at least then I wouldn't be able to cause them more pain. I even have a girlfriend and I dont know why she is together with me. I plead her to break up with me so I don't have a bad conscience anymore to leave. I would be able to just run away from all the things to overwhelm me. I obsess over all the human interaction i do wrongly and just want it to end. I want to stop feel guilty about my failure to not hurt people.. . I often think about driving into the deep woods and to bring my gun with me. To tell my family I am sorry that i made them sad and feel pain, i know they would be ultimately better off without my destructive influence. I failed them. I can't be a positive person, a normal person. I am such an disappointment to myself.. . I will be honest and give you an example of how i hurt the people i love. (I know i am garbage for the way i act). . . My mother has problems with her weight and I encouraged her to lose weight. Eating healthy with her and keeping her mindful. I moved away eight months ago and she gained noticeable weight back. She is happy though but i was mortified. A normal person wouldnt reduce a person to their weight or make hurtful comments because those do not help the situation. I couldnt hide my dissapointment with her weight gain though. Chastizing her, critizising her eating choices, telling her she is killing herself with this weight. I just couldnt stop myself. Couldnt even look at her without feeling angry and dissapointed.. Later my girlfriend confided in me how my mom said: i know that i have gained weight and ""OP"" thinks I am disgusting.. It hurt much to hear this. I have hurt her feelings deeply and only got myself to blame for that. I apologized to my mom and told her i would never think she is disgusting (even though those are my true feelings).. . This is just a small example of my controlling and destructive behavior of mine. I am tired of apologizing and then hurting people again. I truly think I am just a horible person which manages to be kind when everything goes my way, but its just a matter of time when i snap again. Broken and not fit for society. I am tired of hating myself and feeling guilty. What is wrong with me? ",suicide

"Some of us are not allowed to win... ever.I know I am not the only person here who has experienced this pattern of things never working out for us, through no fault of our own. . . Sure, I can get through the mundane activities without incident, but when something big or especially important comes up, you can bet someone is going to put the brakes on my success train. . . A good example is a recent event, I'll keep it vague and hopefully brief. Someone is doing me wrong, lawyer agrees this is wrong and that I have done everything right so far. Lawyer asks me to make a police report to document wrongdoing. I call the cops and of course I get a grumpy Wilford Brimley look-alike, attitude dripping off his walrus mustache, like he is pissed that I took him away from his oatmeal or something. . . Cop hears my story, sees a person doing me wrong right in front of his eyes, declares it to not be too bad and so no report, no action. Report this back to the lawyer, who is confused at why this was allowed to pass. No police report, no case. Of course, because you see, I felt good for a minute there. If a lawyer agrees that you have a case, then perhaps people will finally listen and stop doing you wrong. . . Nope. I am a doormat and the minute I begin to stand up for myself and take steps to prevent being walked all over, someone will shout ""Oh no you don't! You get right back on that floor!"". . I have turned this over and over in my mind. Perhaps I should visit the police station and run this by another officer, since Officer Brimley did not seemed grounded in the law or reality. Perhaps I should talk to another lawyer, to see if my case really does crumble because of one confused cop. . . But why? It has been my experience that I will just get punched in the gut again. This is the pattern in my life. Others can do just about anything, yes I have even been physically assaulted twice in my life and nothing of lasting importance happened to them. . .

"In a reallybad place right nowSo I’m in a horrible state today. Usually I just act like everything’s fine and try living my life the best I can, suppressing every single memory and thought. I know it’s not healthy, but I need to carry on somehow and therapy didn’t work the slightest.. I suppose I just need to get it all of my chest at this point and this sub seems like a good place for this.. . Idk how to start this... You’ve gotta know I look like a happy, blonde chick who’s got everything she could ask for. People think I’m arrogant and rude when I’m actually just scared to talk to them... There’s still a lot more than what I’ll write here, but I want to keep it short.. . I’ve had loads of family issues. My dad cheated on my mother for 12 years. Starting when I was like 3 maybe. They’re still married. But it left him with severe depression and burnout syndrome, he’s drinking as well.. Meaning for me that he never actually was a dad to me. I barely saw him growing up and we never bonded. If we talk he usually just tells me to shut up or hang myself. I can barely bring myself to say hello at this point. So that’s that.. . I was a pretty outgoing child and got along with anyone, but after transferring to middle school at 9 I became extremely shy, insecure and basically ate my feelings.. I became fat and was bullied in school for every single day for over five years. By now, I understand why they did it. I was ugly and too scared to talk after all. I’d rather spend my tome with books and video games than with actual people. That was when I started therapy.. . At 14 I transferred schools and it became much better. I found some friends and my looks changed for the better. I finally felt like being in control at 16. Even though that was the time when my dad‘s cheating was revealed, I handled it quite well considering the situation.. . At 17 I met my first bf, everything was going great. He was a quiet nerd and I really loved that. He was smart, ambitious and made me feel like I was worth something. I felt loved for the first time in my life.. Until he started to make me dependent on him. It began slowly so I didn’t realize it. After about half a year, I felt completely worthless and anything I did was only for the sake of pleasing him. To shorten this: there was verbal and physical abuse, blackmail, rape and other stuff.. . I finally managed to build up the courage to leave, but couldn’t handle it all.. I dropped out of school, started cutting a lot, drank until I passed out, had tons of one night stands to get over my fear of men and took very strong meds. I did anything to simply forget. He proceeded to stalk me and my friends to get me back. I never was so terrified.. I got back into therapy. This was 3 years ago and I still wake up screaming from the nightmares. When I do, I just want to end it all. There’s still mot a single day going by that I’m not terrified of him coming back.. But things only get worse from here.. . In that summer at 17 I made the mistake of telling my dad. He said it was all my fault. I fell into a very deep hole and the alcohol/medication thing got way worse. I didn’t really tell anyone after that.. Except an Internet friend. We’d been talking for quite a while. She proceeded to ask me for very specific details about the physical abuse and rape. Later on she said she used that to get off and blamed me for being mad since „she (mtf pre-op) would never be able to experience this“. She also called me a whore, a slut and whatnot. Needless to say I’d stopped talking to her. She hit me up un Saturday rambling about how selfless she’d always picked me up and what a disgusting person I was for not answering her texts etc etc.. I guess this is what makes me write all this.. . So about the same time of the breakup, my best friend killed himself. I still remember exactly how he told me he knew I could do this all without him and how he’d watch out for me from above.. I still think about how I could’ve saved him. I still think it’s all my fault.. . At 18 I then met a guy I felt like I could trust. We became a couple and moved in together a few months before my 19th birthday. Well a few days before my birthday I found out he hadn’t been paying rent formonths, which got us thrown out. I immediately broke up. I lost all my savings in this.. Haven’t trusted any man ever since. Or anyone at all really.. . Then later that year there was a horrible car crash. Rolled over two times and crashed into a tree. I still get terrified to drive in the rain.. . I’m 20 now and as I said, I try my best to suppress all of this. I’m also completely clean from alcohol and medication, but still cut when I get a panic attack. It’s the only thing that’ll bring me down. Believe me, I’ve tried anything.. . But at this point I’m so scared of people. Scared of being addicted again. Scared of him coming back. Scared of talking to my dad. Honestly often just scared of myself. I’m worrying I’ll just snap and end it all.. It just all terrifies me and I can’t handle it anymore.. . If anyone actually read all this.

I will never forget how were people looking at me, with pure disgust in their eyes, my classmates were laughing at me every day. I was bullied also physically but not that much, in elementary school, I think that's when I lost all of my confidence and became scared of people.. . But looks isn't my only problem, even tho it's one of the biggest causes of my SOCIAL ANXIETY. I can't talk to people, I don't know what to say when I talk to someone, I just became retarded. I don't know how to behave in social situations, I don't know how to react, I just don't know what to say and even if I have something to say, it's always awkward, even if I'm trying to say something funny, people never laugh, so I'm better quiet all the time.. . I was unemployed for 2,5 years, now I work in a job that I hate, making peanuts, I can't expect anything else since I have only high school education. Why? Because I don't have any hobbies, I'm not interested in anything, I don't have any talents, I've been trying to find something since I was 18.. I'm living only with my mom in a one room appartment and our biggest problem is money, since I was a child.. . My mom is trying to do everything for me, even now, and all I want in this life is her to be happy, I don't care about me anymore. I want her to be financially free, to not be stressed every day. But I'm just a failure that can't do anything. . I have to wake up in 4 hours and go to that fucking stupid pointless job again, I don't even want to go to bed, I'm getting anxious even when I think about it :(. . I was working out for like a year a couple of years ago, my body got a little bit better but really just a little bit, I still looked like a fucking weirdo, now it's much worse tho and I don't have any energy to do anything. I'm tired all the time, I don't have any energy, it's like my body already gave up, I don't want to do anything, just leave this body, but at the same time I don't want to, because it would ruin the lives of my family.. . I'm an extremely clumsy and unskilled person, I can't do anything, I don't know anything. . I feel trapped here and I'm not enjoying this life at all. . I tried to write this post not too emotionally, but believe me I feel like the most useless, ugliest, dumbest weirdo in the world.. . I hate this life and I have tears in my eyes when I think about it, because I know how much it would hurt my mom if she saw this post, but that's just how I feel for the last 2 years :(",suicide

I feel like the only reason I haven't killed myself is because of other people. I already feel like a burden, but all I can think about is how much worse of a burden I'd be on whatever poor person had to come looking for me, and find me. The weight of the world is heavy on my chest, and I want so badly to give in. I just don't want to hurt anyone else with my choices. I'm convinced that there is no hope for a better life. I can't afford help, because I have no job, because I'm depressed and socially anxious. I feel like I'm in a cruel cycle of not being able to get the help I need, but unwilling to end it all if it means someone else will have to find me. Life is far too cruel as it is. I don't want to end up being nothing more than something my loved ones have to clean off of a wall and try to distract themselves from when they see just the wrong shade of red. Every day the thought is in my mind. I look at things in my surroundings and think about how practical it would be if that were my weapon of choice. It's like I'm essentially shopping for the method I'm going to use to kill myself. I'm still making plans. Constantly. The only thing holding me back are two parents, a brother, and a SO. It's like I'm holding onto a cliff when I'd rather fall. Not because I want to live, but because of the horrible mess I'd make. I feel my fingers slip a little more every day.

"Don’t know what to doI’ve been suicidal for as long as I can remember. I just started college in another state which is great but things just aren’t what I thought they’d be. I’m trans ftm and I finally started testosterone and I have a top surgery date and I have friends and I feel like things should be getting better but I feel worse than ever. When my dog died three years ago I promised I’d never self harm again but I just broke that promise and I feel horrible for it. I promised I’d live for her but now I don’t see the meaning in that promise. I’ve already failed her so why should any of it matter anymore. I called the suicide hotline three times this week but all I do is cry for ten minutes then they say some stuff then it’s over. I can barely remember the last week because I’ve been dissociating so much. I don’t feel like it’s worth fighting for life anymore. All I do is cause problems and take money and time from my parents and the people around me. I told my friend from back home how I’ve been feeling and she told me to tell someone that’s here so I did. It felt good to tell someone but then he insisted on telling our residential advisor. I don’t think he did anything wrong I just didn’t want him to tell them because they’re a mandatory reporter and the last thing I want to happen is the police get involved or my parents find out or I have to go to a mental hospital. I begged that he wouldn’t tell anyone but at the same time I understood why he couldn’t keep it to himself and I knew it wouldn’t be fair for me to make him deal with that information on his own. The ended up calling the RA and I closed down completely. I’ve resolved that I’ll never tell someone ever again about things like this. I thought it’s help but I feel even worse now and I can’t get myself to look at or talk to anyone. Everything’s horrible and the only solution I have to all of it is to end everything now. I’ve had a note write in for a long time but I’ve never attempted before. I always knew I’d want to jump from a building because then I could feel like I’m flying and if I do it right it guaranteed to be successful. Only problem is I don’t have easy access to any tall buildings. I’m thinking I might just jump from the top of a mountain we have near here. It’d be a while before anyone found me and an animal might get to me first so maybe nobody would have to see my body. The only thing holding me back are my parents. I know they love me and the whole point of me doing this is to make other’s lives easier and I know if I do do this it would hurt them a lot and I don’t want to do that to them. Also there’s still that part of me that wants to live but his voice keeps getting alquileres ad quieter. I’m in so much pain from my head and all the thoughts running through my mind I just want it all to stop. I see no point anymore. No hope. I’ve tried therapy and medication and nothing works. I used to have going to college and started hormone treatment to look forward to but now I have that stuff and nothing’s getting better. I’m getting worse and I’m only 18. How am I supposed to survive another ten years, twenty, or thirty? It’s hopeless and pointless. What about when my parents die. They’ll be nothing to hold me back. There’s no way I die naturally. Either I die of a freak accident before I can kill myself or I kill myself first. Why wait when I can stop all the suffering now?",suicide

Maybe because I can't stand trying to be mad at somebody else when I know that I am the only one I'll ever hate so much.

"I've made my plan and everythingSo, I turned 21 last month and, despite my initial hopes that I'd go out and have a good time, I ended up going to a bar by myself where I just sat and had dinner with a few beers alone. While I was sitting there, I finally realized that I've been depressed for years and years, trying to pretend that things would get better. Things haven't changed for the better, and I'm rapidly coming to the conclusion that they never will. I came to college (and went through most of high school) believing that, out of all the new people, there might be even one who I thought I could say I loved. Constant disappointment has shown me the error of my ways, and I'm just going to leave before I have the chance to learn the same lessons in increasingly harder ways. I'm not going to stick around to see whether or not I become the reclusive and lonely old man living in the house at the end of the block. So I've got a plan. I'm going to jump, which is regrettable, because I would rather have gone out with something more... instant and painless, like a bullet. But, as I'm limited by money, the option that is the cheapest and somewhat instant will have to do. Someone told me that, to feel the relief that I'm seeking, I'd have to be alive to experience it but, at this point, I'm far more comfortable with nonexistence.

I've had depression for the last few years now, no big deal, having all the joy in anything slowly be sucked away is surprisingly tolerable, but at this point I think I've been basically , in dark souls terms hollowed out.

Unironically if someone were to kill me I'd almost consider it a favour at this point, least there would be closure for those close to me other then ""he couldn't tolerate life anymore"", that was the fate of my uncle and first cousin and my family are still recovering from the fall out from that, ""why didn't he say anything"" years on. . . My family are well aware of my depression and I'll be blunt in that talking about it does nothing to talk about it for me, I'm just leeching off them more then I already am at that point.

"I've done this to myselfNever had a reddit account before, I had no idea my first post would be something like this!. . I'm 23 years old and I live in Melbourne, Australia. I have been on and off depressed for as long as I can remember, but I can't recall a period for longer than 3 months where I wasn't deeply unhappy on the inside. I am so afraid of failure that I can't bring myself to find work, even at a bar or retail. I don't have a great relationship with my parents and I am currently living in a single room above a low quality restaurant, just a bedroom and a bathroom.. . I had this great boyfriend, we had normal issues with one another, but I started getting irrationally angry about little things, or making things up if I felt underappreciated. I said I wanted to break it off countless times, because I have been so unhappy and didn't know how else to ask for the affection that I needed. Now I have started doing this to my friends. The boyfriend and I did break up months ago, but we have been seeing each other. I couldn't kick the 'I don't want to see you anymore' habit and it must be a novelty to him by now. I'm such a sour person, I can't hold my tongue and I'm negetive because it's impossible to acknowledge there might be a reason or purpose or happy outcome to anything I do.. . This whole uni holidays I have been sitting alone in my room, occasionally going out and meeting up with friends, but I always feel the same in the end. I really want someone to know that there is something really wrong with me, I want my ex to know that I have been so horrible to him because I don't know what to do anymore, but I can't tell anyone myself, and I feel that leaves me with only one option.. . The thought of wasting a human life disturbs me greatly, I can't bring myself to do anything to make my perfectly healthy body fail, it seems cruel on an organic level. . But every day feels like groundhog day. I wake up, sit at my computer, then go to sleep at the end of the day. I feel like surviving a suicide attempt might alert those around me to my suffering, it might give me another chance with my ex, to not push him away, even though I have had a very long stream of chances. But this is not realistic, and the flaws in my personality that compell me to be a closed off, negetive bitch will follow me to new relationships all my life. I don't know what I would do after uni, I can't see myself succeeding at anything I try, and I have thought like that my whole life. . There just isn't anything about me worth saving, I'm a money sink-hole for my parents and I'm sick of putting my self pity onto my friends. They just want to have a good time and I just want to not exist anymore. I have a very strong urge to give my things away just to make someone notice without me having to say it. I CAN'T say it myself.. . I've spent the last few days looking up how I might kill myself, which I have done many times before, but I am afraid things will just go on the way they are unless I man up and actually do it. I have and will always create scapegoat problems in my relationships, and clearly the signals that I need help and care just aren't getting across. I don't want to talk to a professional, the things I'd have to do to recover are too difficult and scary, if I can't even text my ex saying 'I'm sorry, I need help' out of pride then what hope do I have for anything else?. . I don't know why I'm really even posting this, I don't know what I expect to get out of it.",suicide
"My life is so miserable and the only way I keep myself afloat is through escapismI'm 16, I've been severely bullied for almost 2 years now, I've recently discovered a hate page that posts pictures of me with awful, disgusting captions that are used to entice older men. I have an abusive ex that hates my guts and leaked my nudes. I run the risk of running homeless because my father is so in debt with the utilities and he barely pays our bills. My mom has age-inappropriate expectations for me and treats me as if I'm her therapist, I'm expected to also juggle AP classes at school, study for my SATs and obviously do well. . . There is nothing redeemable about my life. There used to be, but now I cannot think of anything.

"At my worstI've struggled with suicidal ideation since I was 10 years old. I don't even go to anyone about the daily thoughts anymore. I finally sought help and got medicated, but honestly now on my 2nd medication and still think about it daily and the side effects are almost unbearable. It's one extreme or the other when I open up to people. Hearing I'm selfish is one of the most hurtful things I could ever hear. I feel like I have more love to give than most, but no one lets me in. I've always been the weird person, the one that says things in conversations that causes silence, or gets talked over, or straight up ignored. Even professors ignore my discussion posts and e-mails. I have people read them and they say it's not the way I'm wording it, so it's like there's some barrier in the universe against me. All ""advice"" is the same old extremes like ""but you have so much to live for!"" or ""well if you're going to talk about it then just do it already!"". I get angry with myself often for not having the guts to follow through. I feel weak, alone, and afraid. I'm honestly have this fear that I'll be that one person that survives and will be stuck living in even more pain than I already do. I don't have many friends, and the ones I do have either turn out to be horrible people or I manage to mess it up somehow. I have a career and I'm in grad school, so despite my societal appearance I'm falling apart inside. I'm so tired of feeling this way, but I don't feel like there's any hope for me. The thoughts never go away. I always feel alone, unloved, and unwanted no matter what is going on. I had a really rough relationship with my parents growing up. We got along slightly better as I got older, but there was a lot of resentment between us. My dad and I had finally started to get along when he bled to death after a hospital fall two years ago. My mom has Bipolar II (I have been evaluated for that, and thankfully don't have it) and is medicated but it doesn't stop all the symptoms. She is my best friend one week and my worst nightmare the next. I never know when I can depend on her. My boyfriend is wonderful and does a lot for me, but he has severe ADHD which he has only recently become medicated for and we have been through a lot of ups and downs together, including my family despising him because of his lack of a career and poor upbringing (judgmental much). Most of my ""best friends"" are non-existent now. Grad school is a joke. I just can't seem to find the silver lining. I am so tired of feeling like this. I just want to go to sleep and not wake up. I'm not okay and I'm not sure I'll ever be. I can't talk about this stuff with anyone else because it sounds like a bunch of ""pity me"" and ""woe is me"". I know that I am pathetic, but at least it feels good to be able to get my thoughts out there.",suicide

I have begun to make some of my friends hate me, in hopes that they will have nothing to do with me if I finally end it all. I have cut my arm so bad and that doesn't help either.

I'm about to go to sleep now after pulling an all-nighter in an attempt to correct my body clock. I feel pretty awful. The world seems very dark right now, my life has no meaning. I cried really intensely about an hour ago, almost screaming at times. I've been feeling depressed for years, and seriously suicidal for months, but something changed today. All hope seemed to just vanish, and I cried because it really is over now, there's no more excuses. My life is over, there's really nothing left to live for. I thought I had something to hold on to but my faith in that going well has almost left me now. I have no career, no loving family, no friends, no interests, no passions... Just nothing, I don't really exist. I can't wait to go to sleep now, I've been looking forward to this all day. I wish I wasn't waking up tomorrow, if someone killed me in my sleep then I'd be blessed indeed - as so much loneliness, despair, and suffering would be over. Soon I'll be sleeping forever, and I can't wait for this tortuous pain to go away. Oops, I can feel another cry coming on. :'( At least I'm still human.. . Goodnight everyone.

"This is the most I could doFirstly, If you are thinking of sending ‘help’ please don’t. As much as I admire you’re noble intentions; it’s much too late for me. . . I’ve tried getting help it’s not meant to be as the mental health services as has my doctor have concluded that I’m not unwell enough based on my past achievement's.. Also, I’ve not decided to end my life right away but rather I’ll do it after I’ve tied up a few loose ends.. . I have been doing my research and my conclusion is that for me, this will be best for me.. I’m autistic. I lost both my parents, I was an only child and therefore I no longer have any family. I was a full time carer for my mother for 15 years. She was disabled and very sick but my efforts to save her failed. I completed my duties as her carer and her son. But these past two years living for myself brings me no purpose, no happiness, no hope. Just loneliness and a new-found drug addiction that brings me some comfort and pleasure in my lost existence.. . Due to my aforementioned autism, I have difficulty forming relationships (as if being gay wasn't difficult enough). People I do meet after talking to them online like the sound of me but don’t actually like me in person and so don’t give me a chance. I’m in my early thirties and I’ve never been in a relationship that has made me happy; including friendships.. I’m also living with the effects of abuse; I’m no longer being abused however I find myself ruminating about the past and have never truly healed from it.. . Rather than suicide, I see this as an act of euthanasia.. The first time I tried to accomplish this task, it resulted in me laying unconscious for a few days in my house that I lived alone in.. It may not be a natural death, but to me it feels natural. Either existence ceases or I’ll be reunited with all the loved ones I lost; and we can be a family again. But one things for sure; this is the end of my existence that I fought to exist in to the point of exhaustion.. . I don’t know why I’m posting this.

I was told these weren't entered into the system. The first time I apologized and said I was certain I entered it, but oh well. The second time I told administration I was 100% sure I entered it and have had the same issue before. I was told I was being argumentative.

She was given an interview at my work, but failed the drug test even though we haven't smoked pot in 6 weeks. Every time I feel upset about our situation and tell her so, she gets upset.

So I don't.  . .  . But there's nobody I can talk to. I don't have close friends. I don't want to guilt my father, who sacrificed so much for me my entire life and is struggling himself. My extended family are not close. They are religious, and I am a lesbian and an atheist. I try to ignore it and be polite around them, but they can't seem to ignore it. They want to preach to me. I ask them not to, but they ""have to do it even though I don't want it, because they love me."" I don't go to family events anymore. They wonder why.  . .  . I want to stop living.

By my family’s standards, I’ve accomplished the greatest of feats; I’m not pregnant, nor do I have kids or have I had sex. I graduated high school and was going to college. Of course that ended abruptly as most good things do and now I’m left without a passion for art, nor any care about anything else. I don’t care about anything anymore. Before I could think of everything I wanted to do in my life like as in traveling, falling in love, getting married, living off my art or even just owning a small café. But now, it doesn’t matter. I’m too broken to ever be good enough for someone. And since I’m not a loose whore, I will never be with anyone. And I guess not ever now anyway…. . If anyone is even reading this at all, I just want you to know I’m sorry you found me like this. I’m sorry you even had to scrape any part of me off of whatever or had to put up with me at all. I just wish that I had never been an accident in the first place and that I never wasted anyone’s time. I wish my siblings had never known I existed. I wish my parents didn’t have a failure such as I as offspring. I wish my parents all the best and that they can find someone to replace me as a better child. I wish my two best friends hadn’t had to put up with my antics. I wish that I hadn’t made them pay attention to me when I knew they were better off not bothering with me. I wish that I had died the day I fell down the flight of stairs or when I was little. I wish I never hurt anyone by knowing me. I wish I had drowned that day I fell into the ocean.. . I’m sorry [female friend] for being so depressed all the time and making you listen to me when you had to study. I’m sorry that I was always so inconsiderate of what you had to do. I’ve always thought of you as the big sister I always wanted.. . I’m sorry [male friend] for being so embarrassing to be around. I know you resent me for not being what I was supposed to be. I’m sorry that I’m always taking up the time you could be using to be around people who are more important. Thanks for being my big brother.. . I’m sorry everyone else I didn’t name. I’m sorry I’m so forgetful that I can’t even remember people who wasted their time on trying to help me. I never had a chance to go anywhere in this world I was given and I’m so, so sorry you were forced to help me along the way. I appreciated it so much.. . To [both friends]: You two get 25% each of what I owned if you want it. Money included. My mother gets 50% for funeral expense. And as an added bonus, you can burn all of my art. It was crap and I don’t know why I pursued it.. . I don’t know what comes next. But whatever it is, I deserved it. Be happy with that.",suicide

"Compartmentalization Keeps Me GoingI think the only thing keeping me going can be summed up with one word. Compartmentalization.. . I made it through today. One foot in front of the other. This morning started out pretty bad, dealt with grandparents getting pissed off at me for requiring their help yet again. They made it known it was “the last time”. Like I didn’t already expect that. Like I needed to hear all the things they said that I’ve already considered over and over. For some perspective I’m in my mid thirties, only I thing I’ve accomplished is fucking things up worse than I had in my teens.. . Went to a hostel, my last resort beyond the streets. And if I I wind up on the streets then the line I’m walking will probably get thin enough for me to slip off.. . But it didn’t happen. The application to rent by the month for a significantly reduced price actually went through in only an hour and a half. I couldn’t believe it. It was such a singular yet insurmountable barrier.. . Today I made it one step further than I expected to.. . But if I’m being honest, with all the shadows crowding around me, it’s only my ability to compartmentalize that I think is letting me proceed one step at a time. I don’t care if it’s not the healthy way to deal with things it’s literally the only thing keeping me going. Cracking jokes in another subreddit about a game. Watching The Mandalorian or The Witcher while the walls are figuratively burning around me. These blinders I put on are pretty much it.. .

"I'm homeless, jobless, and have lost everything I spent the past decade of my life building.If this isn’t rock bottom, I don’t know what is.. . A year ago I was on the cusp of finishing an Associates Degree in Computer Programming, engaged, and living in a very nice apartment with my fiance and our dog.  I was taking 100mg Sertraline (Zoloft) daily until this past December when I stopped because getting my prescription transferred to the city where we had moved proved to be more of a hassle than I was willing to deal with.  The suicidal ideation returned in full-force.  I feel a near-constant voice in my head telling me to kill myself.  Sometimes I find myself saying it out loud, and I can’t stop.  . . I was working as a pizza delivery driver and due to a combination of slowed business, bad tips, and my unwillingness to look for supplemental work, I found myself unable to pay all of the bills I had.  I focused on paying rent, my car insurance, my cell phone bill, and Christmas presents for my fiance, while my credit cards and student loans went unpaid, then continued to go unpaid for the following months as it became impossible to recover from the increasing fees.  My anxiety was through the roof at this point, and hasn’t improved.. . Around this time, I got involved with a coworker, who was also in a relationship, and we had an affair for several months before she cut me off out of the blue this past April, and refused to speak with me about any of it.  My depression kicked into overdrive and I made plans to prepare an exit bag and kill myself shortly after my 33rd birthday, in May.  I had a tank of helium reserved at a balloon shop in a nearby town.  On the day I had planned to go through with it, I woke up crying, which had been normal for me for several weeks at this point.  The problem being that this time, I couldn’t stop.  My fiance, concerned, called into work and stayed home with me to make sure I was okay.  I confessed to her about the affair I had been having behind her back, and my accumulated debts from unpaid credit card bills and my student loans.  She was devastated by my cheating, but still cared about me and didn’t kick me out.  I spent a month and a half giving her the opportunity to vent her frustrations, ask me questions, and hopefully get whatever closure was possible.  We hadn’t decided whether or not it was possible for us to work things out, but I believe she would have.  I know that she can do better than me, and that I am an emotional and financial burden she doesn’t need, so I made the decision to remove myself.  I would stay until the end of our lease in August and hopefully save up any money that I could to hopefully move into my own apartment.. . In early June, after some unpleasant conversations regarding the returns of personal property with the coworker whom I had an affair with, I got into a confrontation with her boyfriend via text/phone calls after he had destroyed somewhere around $120 worth of my property.  I could have avoided it, but I was angry and it was clear he also wanted the confrontation.  The coworker who I’d had the affair with went to our manager and told him that I had threatened her (which I did not).  After meeting with the store manager and a representative from corporate, my hours were cut back to 10 a week.  Her hours were cut back as well, as they had decided to no longer schedule us on the same day, but that really isn’t the point.  I was financially crippled, and felt I had no choice but to move out early.  I quit my job at the end of June, and my ex fiance agreed to pay the full rent for the remaining lease as I would no longer be living there with her.  Last week, I drove out to Fargo, ND, to stay with a friend and try to get back on my feet.. . I’ve been here for a week, and while I have applied around for work, I have yet to secure a job.  I am 33 years old, I have $79 in my bank account, which will be overdrawn sometime next week once my car insurance and cell phone bills come out through automatic payments.  I started seeing a therapist last week, and this week she diagnosed me with Borderline Personality Disorder, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Dysthymic Disorder, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder.  My ex-fiance, who is also a therapist, believes that I also have an unspecified Dissociative Disorder, however I have repeatedly refused to allow her to use her professional skills to help me.  . . I promised my ex that I wouldn’t kill myself, but I don’t know what else to do at this point.  Nothing makes me happy, or feel anything at all for that matter.  I have no motivation outside of the shame of being a burden on yet another person in my life.  I’m tired of trying to hide my depression and crying and pain from everyone.  I don’t want to live anymore and I don’t believe there is any fixing me.",suicide

A year later my sister moved to another state. Her and I were very close, so it crushed me to hear that she was moving but I understood why. . . Fast forward another year, my dad decides to take my brother and move to a different state. This leaves me the last one left in the state that we all grew up in. . . I was engaged to a wonderful woman that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. We bought a house and had our wedding day set. We both were running our own separate stores, trying to settle in our new house, and plan a wedding. The stress got to me so I asked to push back our wedding date. She decides to distance herself from me which made me depressed. After her always telling me to come to her with any issues, I told her about my depression. That is when she decided it was too much and left me that night. . . Another year passes and I sold the house to move closer to my sister. I wanted to be a part of my niece and nephew's life. It was a fresh start in a new state. I met a wonderful woman where we both supported each other, whatever choices we made. I got offered the position I was trying to get for years but it required traveling. Of course my girlfriend says to go for it. She broke up with me over text while I was out of town for work. . . Few months later my boss decides to fire me after working for the same company for ten years. Ten years wasted working my ass off instead of going to school. . . That was the night I decided to end it. Twelve klonopin down, I felt like it was time to seal the deal. Had about ten more pills and alcohol ready. Decided to call my sister tell her how I was feeling. Little did I know the ambulance were on their way. . . One month later after spending a week in a psych ward, I met the love of my life from an online dating app. He was always there for me. He promised me to always be there for me. I let the walls I built up down for him. He always made time for me and always listened to what I had to say. He always encouraged me and pushed me to go further even though I was struggling with depression. A year later, he cuts me out of his life on his birthday.. . I am sent back to a psych ward where I was able to convince them I wasn't a harm to myself or anyone else in a day. . . My sister decides it's too much to try to be there for me and won't talk to me. . . Here I am crying, writing this post, staring at a bottle of pills. I have a good job, with a promising career. I don't care. I'm buried in medical bills, debt I racked up when I was making good money, and living in a place I can't afford without a roommate. My dad constantly talks about how bad his health is. His time is close. I look for any reason to keep going. I've lost all motivation. . . My biggest regret in life was making that phone call to my sister. I wouldn't be here if I would have just shut my phone off that night. . . . I know there's a lot of information missing. I was no way perfect in any of those relationships. I only have myself to blame for everything that has happened to me. Why keep living when all I do is fuck up my own life every step of the way?. . Thanks if you spent the time to read my post. No, I haven't done anything to try to kill myself, I just dont want to live.",suicide

I’m so sick of living.Male. Everyday feels like a painful existence I’m starting to believe that nothing matters. The worst part is I’m so young and don’t know if I belive in god anymore. And if it is I don’t want to go to hell. I don’t want to die. But I do. I hate living. It feels like the same thing everyday. I only care about my brother grandfather and one of my friends at this point. I hate living. I want to die. I use to cut my wrist when I was 11 I honestly feel like I wish the end was coming. I hate that I’m too scared to die. I want to just finish it but the pain scares me. I want to tell me friend but I can’t. I hate this. I don’t want to live.,suicide
"another post, new storyBefore we start, here's a little back round information. Without saying this, my post won't make any sense:. . \- I was born, raised, and still live in Michigan, USA. Parents were divorced ever since I was 2, I'm currently 16, and currently in a whole lot of trouble, physically and mentally. . . \- My dad is a christian father with a new wife and 2 other kids besides me. . . \- My mom is a stay-at-home mom with 3 other kids besides me and is dating a dude who goes to work all day to support the family, but is always grumpy, because his job sucks. . . \- My mom is a weed addict and is allowing minors to do it in the house, pressuring me to do it. . . \- I'm a part of LGBT, and my dad doesn't support me in any way because of how it's wrong. He had problems with this one person I liked a few years prior. . \- I'm dating a non binary person (the person my dad had problems with, but he doesn't know), and this past Halloween, we had some time together, and my mom thinks we had sex, but we didn't, they just left a few hickeys. We're dumb kids, I know.. . Let's get into the shitshow. . I'm a lazy person, always have been. I don't really listen or do what others ask of me, and that's already bad enough. But with the whole situation of COVID, it made things a whole hell of a lot worse. School started about 3 months ago, and I've done nothing but dick off and play video games with my friends, becoming extremely behind in my classes. I'm really unmotivated to do any schoolwork and I feel like a complete asshole about not wanting to do anything. I'll think about doing something and how much it'll suck, but I just have got to sit through it and just get it done. But the second I sit down to do it, i'll do everything in my power to not do it, or get distracted extremely easily. . . Me being behind in school has gotten my mom fed up with it, having ""anxiety attacks"" as she calls them and starts screaming at everyone who lives at the house. Everyone realized who she's mad at and starts yelling at me too, basically disowning me and threatening to throw me out at age 16. I'd usually call my dad and ask him to come pick me up so we can talk about it and stay at his house for a few days. But today was different. My mom went off on her normal spew of garbage, guilt tripping me again, but I decided ""no, i'm gonna stand up for myself for once,"" but oh boy, did I break hell loose. I asked If I can go back on my medications and told her how it could help me in my lack of motivation, ADHD, depression, etc. She called up my dad and started yelling at him about me being a failure in life and needing pills to survive in the real world. She then started telling a lot of things he doesn't know about like the hickeys, be dating the same person he had issues with, and possibly having sexual intercourse, aka telling him we did. There is no way I can talk this one out with him. His house used to be a safe place, but now it's just as bad as my mom's. He's on his way as I'm typing this. . . I have never considered committing suicide harder than I have right now. I've been having suicidal thoughts for about a year, and always was afraid of death. But now, I really don't know. I genuinely don't know what to do. I'm just this terrible person that my family hates, so i'd assume it'd be better If I left, but I can't go anywhere because of me being underage to leave and not come back, at least legally. So me just killing myself seems like a better alternative. Does anyone have any advice to stay strong during times like these?",suicide

"Little sister is the favorite in my family (Inspired by a post from u/XxAnonymousxX33333) My little sister is the clear favorite out of the four at home (the oldest is a fully functional self-dependent adult so of course they would like her), but I think I'm the only one that realizes it. They don't scold her for anything, she get in minor trouble over anything major, at 12 years old still acts like a 6 year old turd, she cries and whines and gets annoyed over anything we do (e.g. looking in her direction, mentioning her in any context, existing on the same plane of the universe as her, pointing out an obvious fact like ""your lasagna has been in the fridge for ten days, can I eat it before it molds?"", making noise, and walking past her) and she can do any harm to us and it doesn't matter because ""we were probably picking on her."". . Contrastingly, If I do just about anything that isn't specifically perfect, nice, agreeable, exactly what my dad wants me to be doing whether said or unsaid, or productive, I get yelled at. If I protest in any way, even by saying ""what did I do"" or ""why"", I get sent to my room with instructions to do nothing that I would enjoy (not in those words, but that's what they mean). If my sister talks to them, they are understanding, nice, and genuinely good parents. For me, though, they always say ""you can talk to us about anything,"" but if I mention any sort of negative feelings about anything, especially people, I get in trouble. If I point out the obvious things that should change for her to get fair treatment, I'm the one in the wrong. If I disagree with anything they have ever said, I need to sit in my room until I can agree with them.. .

"Feeling on the vergeI've been dealing with my depression off and on for a little over a decade. I'm 27 now and have started taking anti-depressants again (Celexa) after taking them for the first time when I was 18. My stomach is pretty weak and the meds (Effexor) before took their toll on my body, causing almost daily morning nausea which just brought me lower and lower so I stopped after a few weeks. Currently dealing with the same symptoms after starting it up again, and it's absolutely crushing me. My suicidal thoughts have become almost daily now and its wearing me down. . . I started a job last year as a part of my school program that I absolutely love and is a great fit for my lifestyle(flexible hours, independence). When I worked there as part of the school program I was the happiest I had been in a long time, not remembering more than a day or two I was down the entire 8 month span I was there. Coming back to school has brought back my moods and I feel as if I have checked-out emotionally/mentally from thinking about school which is causing me a lot of problems with trying to finish my classes. I've failed multiple classes in the past due to mostly laziness on my part, but even now that I've been given a second chance to retake them, I'm throwing the opportunity out the window.. . I opened up recently to my fiancee about my thoughts and she is obviously concerned, and made a comment about noticing my behaviour since we resumed school. She wants me to continue, and even my boss said it would be better for me in the long run if I decide to look elsewhere for work, but we have already discussed about me staying there for a few years of work at least. I want to do right by my fiancee and even my mom. I want to make them proud and graduate but I can't keep my head above water.

"What is Life?Did I ever think anything would be this fucked up? Hell no. But here I am. I'm a stalker, a night owl, a creep, and much more. I can't tell you how many times I've driven by her house wondering what she was doing. Wondering if she was thinking of me, or if she was fucking some new guy. Wondering if she would ever text back or if she blocked me for good. I'll never know. . . I've been obsessed with her for seven years. Ever since I laid eyes on her, I can't get her out of my head. I used to dream of being with her and being able to call her my own, but that day will never come. She's always ""busy"", ""tired"", or ""unavailable"". Same old excuses and I know it's because she's sick of me. Tired of me bugging her, tired of my shitty jokes, my terrible flirting... . . What more can I say. I'm just some stupid guy that thinks she's cute, right? Wrong. I know everything about her. We used to talk about our lives every day and help each other. I used to think she actually cared about me and that maybe I had a chance, but boy was I wrong. I never realized she was way out of my league until it was too late. I spent all of high school trying to be with her and I never got my chance. . 	. My entire ""youth"" is being ruined by thoughts of loss and hatred for other people, including her. I hate my parents, I hate my siblings, shit, I even hate my friends. Backstabbing bastards. I wish I could end myself without any regrets here on earth. I hope that one day I can do just that. When everyone who ""cares"" about me finally forget about me, I'll make my move. I want to overdose on heroin in a one bedroom apartment where nobody will find me for weeks. I don't want anyone to worry, I don't want anyone to wonder ""where is he today?"". I just want to be alone with my mind so I can go in peace. . . I've already thought of the song I'll go out to. Probably something like ""Creep"" by Radiohead. Something that reminds me of who I am: a worthless fucking creep. I've not even experienced other drugs. I can't wait to try molly, acid, and other hallucinogens. I want to be out of my mind before I go. I thought about deleting everything, including Facebook, Instagram. Twitter, email, snapchat, etc. I even thought about not responding to texts anymore unless they say ""why are you doing this?"". What will I respond? I'll say, . . ""I'm doing this for myself, and nobdoy else. Go on with your life. Be happy without me. That shouldn't be too hard, right?"". . I want it to be over.",suicide

"Much Like Everyone Else HereGiven the frequent calls for help, writing anything here is a bit of a gamble.. . I can *feel* that I'm losing the will to live, but I'm not there yet. I've made request after request, seen numerous therapists, taken numerous meds from numerous psychiatrists, and feel like I'm just delaying the inevitable. As if, somehow, a miracle will happen by crying out so often.. . I know I need to earn my place in life. I'm just so tired. Literally tired. I've been emotionally tired for a while now, but in recent weeks I've had a hard time retaining any energy.. . One or two weeks ago, I saw a homeless man pushing his broken cart down the street in front of my house. He was mumbling to himself with a dead look in his eyes. He was alone, but muttering to himself. Just seeing this stunned me. It was like several fears and thoughts were struggling to get in my head at once. Many of us, the hopeless, feel like that already. Wandering alone, feeling unsafe, feeling helpless, but pushing on because that's what we're told to do. That guy just happened to be even worse off.. . Is that what we're doomed to be? Helpless shadows of our former selves, wandering anywhere because we're not wanted anywhere?. . &amp;#x200B;. . I'm letting fear get the best of me. This would be the place to do it though. Better to become rattled in writing, than to be rattled where it'd bother people that know me.. . &amp;#x200B;. . You're talking to yourself, at this point, Joe. But that's fine. A ""note"" to look back on, maybe. The chance to get my thoughts out, at least.. . I repeat myself all the time on this site. Rarely on this subreddit, but I've dotted several others with pleas for help, or requests for suggestions. I don't even know how common my kind of cases show up. Am I just another drop in the ocean? People have responded to my entries before, but very rarely do I find what I'm looking for.. . Jeez. What *am* I looking for? There's no ""cure"" for depression as of yet. Not the biological kind, anyway. I barely know much about dysthymia, polymorphism HTTLPR-5, and my other topics to avoid at dinner. I only know most of them are biological. My meds help. Sure. They don't make me feel ""good"", but they make me feel better. I've recently been having nightmares of scenarios that mimic those feelings I had, when things were worse.. . I live in shame lately. Feeling unwanted, or rather, tolerated. I believe my brother and my mom love me, but sometimes I feel that I'm too much of a burden. At the same time, I know they'd reassure me with that empathetic, yet fiery, look in their eyes. Conviction. Almost upset with me for thinking otherwise. It's a weird comfort.. . I feel like I almost don't exist outside these walls sometimes though. I have very few ""exceptional"" qualities. I'm not attractive, I'm unemployed, I'm emotionally unstable, my insides look like bags of fruit punch trying to squeeze through plastic nets, I struggle to ""feel alive"", and I'm terrible at maintaining contact with the friends I have.. . I know its not healthy to dwell on my negative qualities, but I don't think I've ever had someone close to me *truly* believe in me. At least, not in a long time. I kinda squandered that in my stupid teenage years. Now I get treated like a kid announcing that he wants to be a dinosaur when he grows up, whenever I talk about what I want to do in my future.. . If someone was reading this, they certainly stopped by now. Still, I might as well keep writing. I sound crazy even to myself, but at least this offers some stress relief.. . I remember when I used to blame ""luck"", or something conspiring against me, for my misfortune. I know it's not true now though. My misfortunes are my own doing. The odds of me being a victim of circumstance for this long are very unlikely. Still, I think that it's possible for *someone* to be that unfortunate. I hope I'm wrong though. No one deserves to be *that* miserable.. . Where was I going with this? Suicide? Yeah. I feel like I'm just running low on willpower. I'm sure lots of people are feeling weaker and sadder lately, given recent events. Once this is over though, they will be able to heal. Not me though. This crap is has been tattooed into my head since I was eleven.. . I'm not trying to be ""bleak"". It's just how things have been for about two-thirds of my life. The odds of things changing now require that aforementioned ""miracle"".. . I pray this will pass though. I'm not dead yet. I *want* to get better. As sad as it is to say, I know some people just want to be miserable. I was once like that too after all. *That* kind of thinking is crazy. But I understand feeling so weak that you just want the credits to finally roll. Sometimes it would just seem easier to sleep and never wake up. Dream of feeling valued, for the rest of eternity.. . As nice as it would be for that to happen, I need to be realistic. I knew as soon as I started this drawn-out message that nothing would change. I welcome being wrong, but if so many professionals and nearly two decades of fighting can get me out of this, why would I expect someone to suddenly appear with my remedy? My cure?. . What hurts is that this pain is not mine alone. I *know* there are others out there who have it far worse than me. My nightmares happen when I'm asleep, but at least I live in a loving home. Some people don't even have *that* luxury.. . Write something later, Joe. You're clearly feeling particularly negative at this moment. Even if those thoughts go unanswered, at least you will have cemented some better thoughts to look back on.. . It feels silly writing to *myself*, but there's a small comfort in it. Immediately followed by regret upon remembering my memory of the homeless guy muttering to himself.. . Whatever. Hopefully things will be more manageable in the morning.",suicide

But, I disagree with everyone comparing this to the killing of George Floyd. Those murders are completely different and shouldn’t be compared. One was racially motivated by someone who’s job is to protect the American people while the other was a crazy man killing a little boy. The murder of Cannon Hinnant was terrible but it in no way should be used as a way to discredit BLM in any way. The only reason this murder was a big deal is because it was the most recent Black on White murder so anti-BLM people could exploit it.

And then my internet loaded, which changed my life forever.. . #OFFICIAL r/TEENAGERS MERCH DROP!. . This was the first thing I saw. I immediately dropped my phone and began hyperventilating. It took a few minutes to calm down, but I still get goosebumps thinking about how many virtual Reddit doors had opened up for me.. . I grabbed my credit card. And then with my heartbeat soaring, I ordered everything on the site. I received a receipt in my e-mail shortly after. The feeling that the mod team behind r/teenagers had sent me a RECEIPT for their official r/teenagers merch made me cry tears of joy. I printed it out at a rapid paste and stuck it to my wall.. . I am the #1 r/teenagers fan in the world. I have the sub’s official logo tattooed on my chest and one time a mod for the subreddit said “Good meme!!” when referring to my classic 2018 meme, which harshly criticised Instagram Fortnite normies.. . I was not expecting the life-changing experience that occurred for me this morning. But here we are and I am feeling truly enlightened by today’s events.. . If there’s one thing I want you to take out of this post, it’s to never give up and follow your dreams.

"GUYS WTF JUST HAPPENED..... About them: So most Kurdish people believe in these 'ghosts' called 'Eshma Chetr' (you won't find them on google) including my parents, my parents siblings, and my ancestors but not me and my siblings. So they say that there was a mom, her son, and her daughter who died of starvation (no they're not African American) because someone trapped them in their basement and would only feed them 1 nan (flat circle bread) a day. But one day he went to his basement to give them a nan but not a single body was found. The next few days people somehow found out about it and reported it but still no bodies were found. The guy was sentenced to life in prison tho. There was no windows or any other exit for them to escape but they somehow did. They could not be found anywhere. So after that incident, everyone who put a whole meal with a nan and left it alone for hours, only the nan would slowly get eaten. Everyone started doing it but it stopped working after a year or so. Anyways enough about the bread getting eaten, they also found out that they showered once a week specifically on Wednesdays and if you showered on Wednesdays and hit one of them and if they got injured then you'd get injured and if they died they you'd die. So no one showered on Wednesdays. And that never stopped so it's still going on only in Kurdish.. . What just happened to me: So my parents still don't let us shower on Wednesdays even tho me and my siblings think it's bs. But the other day my sister woke up at 6am (I was awake to see it because I was pulling an all nighter) to shower so my parents wouldn't know and she hasn't got injured or anything yet so that proved to us that it's bs. But today I went to the bathroom with my phone and I flushed once. Then I waited for like 10 minutes and (no joke) it just flushed on it's own. I thought that I accidentally flushed it so I didn't think of it too much. Then another 15 minutes later it flushed on it's own again. This time I was 100% positive that I didn't flush it so I said that if it flushes 1 more time than I gotta get tf outta there.

Read my post historyI just need to be encouraged because I won’t do it on my own. Everyone else on the planet hates my guts. See the bile that I’ve been writing for years now. Anyone can admit to themselves after reading the hundreds of posts I’ve written about this that everyone hates me and I deserve to die slowly and painfully. I deserve to be tortured in every way a person is supposed to be tortured. I’m supposed to be hurt. So please hurt me. Please make it slow.

"My failureLast night I decided to kill myself.  Obviously I didn't succeed.. It's not a new thought to me; the first time I tried, I was 11 or 12 years old.  My parents were going through what was essentially a divorce in every way except legally, meaning that they were emotionally and physically apart but still lived under the same roof ""for my sake.""  They still do, and they hate each other.. That was 5ish years ago, and after getting my heart broken by my best friend, I decided to do it.  Every hope and dream I had was shattered and out of reach.  I had distanced myself from the rest of my friends and my family was in shambles.  My beloved dog passed away just 2 months ago, and one of my friends I had made in the mental hospital jumped in front of a train just one month prior to that.  Why stick around?. I was so ready to do it.  I knew it would hurt like a bitch, but at that point it was 2 am and I was distraught and exhausted.. But standing there with the rope around my neck, I was suddenly accosted by what I suppose is my survival instinct.  It was as though I was every age I've ever been and every age I have yet to be all at once.  The little kid in me still wanted to grow up, go to prom in the spring, graduate, see college, buy a horse, fall in love...  And my future self seemed to be telling me that I'm being immature, and that as I grew older my problems now wouldn't seem so vast.  And then there was my current self, begging me to die.. I stood there for a long time before I eventually went back to my room.  I was crying, and my best friend was frantically texting me and begging me not to go even after he broke my heart just 2 hours earlier. . Now I don't know what to do.  Standing there in the cold gave me some perspective (but I know that I'll most certainly get hospitalized when I tell my therapist all this).  I suppose that the hopeful little kid in me still wants to try, even though each and every wish seems wildly out of reach.  . Thank you for reading.  I just wanted to put this out there before I inevitably get sent back to inpatient.",suicide

"15 year old struggling with Trichotillomania Hello, I am a 15 year old girl and I Have been struggling with Trichotillomania for the past year. I only have pulled in one specific spot right in the top of my head. I usually pull on my bed and let it flow down to the carpet.  Me and my therapist are trying to help me stop it but It just won't go away.  I went on a 2 week stop then started pulling again. I know its not stress because when I'm just laying in my bed watching anime, I just pull. And yesterday, my dad was playing with my bird and noticed my hair was starting to grow back but it had a bald spot right next to it and said "" When you pull your hair, you just make yourself less pretty.""

"I just honestly don't know what to do... I'm so alone, My only friend left my life, and idk how much longer I can hold on. please help if you can...Well guys, this is my second time being on this page. First was a few months ago and was roughly about the same issue. Having a falling out with my best and only friend Jasmine... I tried to kill myself then. It didn't work out to well and I ended up in the mental hospital for about 2 weeks. Honestly, that did help me a lot but idk why but lately everything has just been hitting harder. For awhile I thought I was doing better. I wasn't thinking about her or missing her or anything. But I don't know why but within the past like 2 weeks I can't take my mind off of missing her. I still don't really have any friends. I also work alone. While I have a family they don't much like me so I stay in my room when I am home. This friend I had really was my everything. We talked everyday and hang out normally at least 2 times a week but some weeks we hang out as much as 5 or 6 days. I can honestly say I loved her both as a person but also in the romantic way. but being honest I know I relied on her too much for happiness. For 2 years we were best friends. However, I started to get jealous and needy because she started to ignore me and stuff. I know that was wrong. I wasn't dating her or anything. Even if i was she can talk to whoever she wants. but anyway, on august 4th she couldn't take it anymore and told me basically she didn't want to be friends with me anymore. Because she was my ONLY friend it hit hard. and roughly a week after I tried to kill myself. After I got out of the hospital I honestly, I was still obsessed with her. Because at the time I wasn't just losing a best friend who had told me she'd always be there for me I was losing ALL of my social contact. To be honest, I went a little crazy. I ended up making a fake account to talk to her. While talking to her I asked about myself to see her feelings about me. I did for about two weeks until the guilt got to me and I tried to end the talking to her. I went about it wrong and she found out it was me. Trust me, Looking back I understand why it was weird, creepy, and just plain fucked up. I really cared about this person. I just couldn't let go. I've been going to therapy and it's helped a lot. But that brings me to now. Sadly, I still really care about her. She's said some AWFUL things to me. She's told me she hopes I die, that she hopes I go to jail and get raped, etc. Just stuff I could never wish on another person. She HATES me. I know we will never talk again even if a dumb part at the back of my mind says ""well maybe you will one day"". I know it's not true. But I still care about her and want the best for her. The last time she messaged me (to try and make me feel bad for what I had done to her) she told me how her life was falling apart. How she was cutting, drinking, doing bad in college, her relationship was doing bad etc. That was like a month ago and I still think about it and worry about her. I have no way to contact her to see if she's okay. She's blocked me on everything. I wish I could just forget about her and move past it. What makes it so hard is not only do I miss her as a person but I miss having a friend. Right now I have no one. I work alone, might as well live alone, and thanks to covid couldn't even go to socialize if I wanted to. I go days without hearing another person. It's all just getting to be so much. I've never felt more alone. I realized in therapy that for awhile I've been pushing people away who care about me. It's part of what makes me even more sad. At the end of the day while our friendship wasn't perfect and she did do some not amazing things I honestly know my actions were the main reason our friendship ended and I even understand why she hates me. I hurt her, I tricked her into talking to me, I basically tried to manipulate her. She has every reason not to talk to me. I just... I just don't know what to do from here on. I'm thinking about her a lot, just wishing I knew how she was. I told her before we stopped talking if she ever really needed someone to talk to i'd be here for her but she told me to go fuck myself. So I can't get her off my mind, I miss her, I really truly still care for her and wish her the best, but i'm so fucking alone and depressed. I'd give anything just to go back and be a better person. I know she deserved it but now I gotta live witht he fact one of the nicest, kindest people I've ever met who for most of our friendship really cared about me, she even said she loved me hates me so much now.... I just don't know how long I can keep going on like this but I know I won't be able to last much longer.",suicide

YoU aLwAyS hAvE tO WiN.. . dad- storms out of bathroom “well i’m sorry you can’t apologize properly!”. . my dad thinks it’s always a win lose thing, and never admits to being in the wrong, actually glorified how right he is all the time once. . i’m so sry this is so long and badly written. i’m so distraught and angry that i just had to get it partly off my chest. if u read all the way through, thank you.",non-suicide

this resulted in me actually being able to properly calm them down the next few times a was near them during a panic attack. . • bug had one that was also after school during dance practice.     -our english teacher called us up to the classroom as everyone else packed up while they were calming down.     - asked why they had a panic attack and when bug started to hyperventilate, she kept asking but more forcefully.     - i mostly spoke for them as they started shaking and couldn’t speak properly.     -she couldn’t understand that anxiety attacks can happen even if the person felt safe and didn’t know what caused it.     - we told her about brad and other possible reason but she kept looking at bug weirdly .     - she confiscated bugs ds, which they were holding and messing with to prevent them from scratching themselves because she assumed they were ‘playing’.     -i had to hold bugs hands to prevent them from starching themselves as they kept shaking.     -

i wasn’t even in her class.     - my english teacher sided with her and i lost all respect for them.     - as a result, i learned that i don’t need to care about them, and moved on.     - i blocked them both as soon as the year ended and only keep up with my science teacher.     - also found out that the 7th grade teacher called a good friend of mine a b*tch for also asking her a question . . • i regret staying friends with brad for as long as i did, as i kept talking to him despite bug telling me not to.     -i’ve cut all contact and recognize him as a horrible person now. . i think that’s all for now. please tell me if i’ve violated any rules or anything, i’ll delete this immediately if so. .

"I need to share this it’s literally so funny to me and I can’t believe it Mobile warning!!. . So I was watching greys anatomy last night (don’t judge lol) and for a little backstory my family’s account was hacked about a year ago and all our individual profiles and progress on everything disappeared, so I haven’t watched greys since because it’s a super long show and I didn’t know where I was in the series since progress was lost, so this was literally the first episode I watched since to find my place.. . So anyway, I’m watching and like 10 minutes into the episode, there’s this minor character who had come in because his p*nis was swollen from sticking it in a hornets nest (gotta love tv writing). The beginning credits were still appearing on the screen a bit, but at that point it was the actor names of the people who were guests on the show, and one of them caught my eye as the scene played out with the patient, who looked very familiar btw. . . When that one credit popped up that caught my eye, I somehow knew it was for the hornet guy, and so I did a little research on him cause I do that a lot and I wanted to know where I had seen him before.. . Get this: I had never seen him before, at least not consciously. Who I HAD seen was his BROTHER. Who’s his brother, you might ask? . . MY FREAKING GOVERNMENT TEACHER from senior year (I just graduated).. . That’s right, hornet penis guy is the previously unknown (by me) brother of my history teacher from high school! I told my friends of this discovery, and none of them like me, knew he had a brother, or that he was an actor.. . Besides this one awkward role, he’s been in a ton of movies with actual Hollywood people, and is friends with a ton of celebrities I know of, but the craziest part is I had no idea, and this one random Netflix watching led me to find out all this! It’s crazy how I just happened to watch that episode and see his name, and that he was my teacher’s brother, who lives halfway across the us from him and otherwise has no connection to him, other than being brothers.",non-suicide
"The Bipolar Monster.There was once a young boy who grew up in the Midwest. They were known as the class clown going through school, and prided themselves in making people smile or laugh. They were bright, creative, and funny. This childlike happiness lasted til about their sophomore year of high school. Their mother had started having problems of her own, becoming more mentally ill and erratic and less of the caring mother they had known. Then she started attempting suicide many times, mostly with pills, but one time with a kitchen knife. The boy even found his mother one day, asleep in the attic as if she was hiding. The boy and his sister tried to rouse their mother, but something seemed very off. She woke up, but was barely conscious. The kids called their father in a panic and he rushed home from work. While they were waiting, the young boy had carried his mother downstairs and sat on the couch with his mother in his arms. His sister had brought some coffee to try and keep their mother awake. The young boy honestly feared in that moment, that his mother would die in his arms that night.   . . . After some time, his mother got better and found the help she needed. While very thankful and glad for his mother's well being, he felt like something had changed in him, emerged or was set free from within. Thinking back, the boy had the warning signs that something was wrong with him, but it was always chalked up to kids acting like kids. Things kept getting worse for the boy. He started feeling more alone, started caring less, and was getting more angry. They tried to smother their feelings with drugs and cigarettes.   . . . One day, the young boy met some new friends. For the first time in a long time since the incident with their mother, they were happy. He felt like these friends understood him, and that he understood them. He felt like he belonged for once. Things were great for a whole summer, he made many fun memories. But his senior year of school came, he was more stressed and depressed than ever. And it was taking a toll on his new friends. After a while, his outbursts became too much for them, and the same people who said they'd always be friends with the boy had left for good. The boy blamed himself for a lot of things, like this, and his mother's suicide attempts. The boy had felt like somehow, this was all his fault, and to a degree it was. The boy was far from perfect, he cried too much, he got too angry, he was simply too emotional. And he was raised to believe that men are strong people who control their emotions.   . . . One day the boy was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder type II, the same mental illness his mother has. He no longer felt like a normal human being, he was a bipolar freak, a bipolar monster who couldn't control them-self and hurt the people that cared for him. It was a hot and erratic stream of anger and thoughts coursing through his sick mind, he would say mean hurtful things he didn't mean, and regretted the harsh words greatly. But he couldn't stop himself. He wouldn't listen, he wouldn't learn. As soon as he got upset, it was like a worse version of himself would take over and then go away after the damage was done.   . . . For years, this kept going on. And the boy made more friends. But lost them all too soon enough. No amount of sorry or regret could make up for the damage he caused.   . . . The boy got more and more depressed, and hated himself whole. He started to talk about suicide more and more and it kept driving his friends away. Even his calm, rational, understanding best friend had had enough of his negative talk. ""You're being selfish and narcissistic."" His former best friend said in regards to his suicide plans. Then his best friend left too.  . . . All of this was the boy, no, the monster's fault. All because he couldn't just get over his mental illness. He was selfish, a loser, and a burden to everyone he met. He's sick of driving people away. He wants to die. He wants to free the world from the mental illness that he can't manage. The monster will die alone.  . . . I am the bipolar monster.",suicide

"A good friend of mine has been battling depression all his life. Today he very casually told me that he has picked a day that he is going to kill himself.My friend is currently an Economics professor and cerebral brainiac. He was taken away from his family early on in his life because his parents were alcoholics and abusive. His ""high school sweetheart/soul mate"" married someone else. He ended up becoming a merit scholar and did his undergrad through PhD at Stanford.. . Now he lives by himself. He has low self-esteem. He's very awkward. And almost afraid of interacting with other people. He recently disconnected his phone. He disconnected his wifi. He has a car but refuses to use it. He basically is disconnecting himself from society.. . And just today he told me very nonchalantly that he has picked a day to kill himself. He said that he had picked a day last year but his new professorship changed his plans. He said he has less than 75 days left.. . He believes he has no friends and no one cares about him. He's also started giving his money and possesions away. I tell him pretty regularly that I care about him but that doesn't seem to make a difference. He doesn't seem to want my help.. .

"Im at my breaking point and i just need to vent or i feel like ill explode    Im gonna give some context and backstory. Im 17 and first off im from a really fascist &amp; secular country. Our economy is going off the deep and unemployment is pretty much inevitable. I have Aspergers &amp; im very socially awkward, along with having an eating dissorder for 5 years and having been a victim of sexual abuse for just as long. My father is bipolar and has made my life a living hell for around three years now. The reasoning for this is something i wont get into but i was kicked out at age 15 along with my mother and sister and we were all sent death threats over the course of staying with a friend. Ive been called every slur and insult you can think of and constantly am threatened with being disowned for any mistake i make. My mother refuses a divorce since she isn’t a citizen of the country we are in now and doesn’t want to move back to her homeland (despite it being so much better than where we are no) just because she says she likes her freedom here and not having to work that much. . .      At age 12 i had basically no one to turn to. My dad has always been abusive and would threatened to slap me if i didn’t listen to him or in worse cases stick my hands into his feces. However since he’s obsessed with being a “good person”  hes nice the other 70% of the time and people adore him. I was a total outcast with 0 confidence so i turned to someone i had met online for validation. They were a lot older than me at  this point but we had a “relationship” and a big part of it was exchanging sexual favors, which i only sometimes made excuses for not going along with because i was terrified of losing the one person i cared about and this went on for years. Around this time i developed an eating disorder that has destroyed my health and i cannot keep any food down at this point. Not one time has either of my parents noticed how badly im suffering despite losing an absurd amount of weight and bruising all the time. I recently got out of said relationship and im together (i think...?) with someone i love so much. They were my only reason for not ending it and recently theyve stopped talking to me without giving a clear reason, telling me they’ll let me know when we can meet up and “talk things through as it would be better”. So i can only assume that once again im being left to my own resources. . .    The country im in is horrible. The people here are horrible. The laws and anyone in the government is horrible. I can always move out once im 18 but my mothers side of the family is a mess involved in drugs and abusive marriages. My fathers side of the family i dont talk to at all. I have a few friends but i know we will drift away once they go to collage. Im afraid of moving to another country on my own. I know for a fact that i cannot make it on my own. I know for a fact that without help from my parents financially i cannot do anything. I dont care at this point. I dont want a job, family, anything. All ive wanted for as long as i remember is to be happy. And i thougt i had finally found it, but if theres anything ive learned in my 17 years its that nothing actually goes well for me and it was my own fault for ever getting my hopes up. . . Yes im young and there are things that can give me purpose, yes every teen goes through a depressive phase. But chalk it up to me being a weak piece of shit that cannot handle this anymore. I dont want to try and be happy, it always ends the same way and its hurts so much more. I have absolutely 0 resources to get out of my situation and even if i did, whats the point. Im already messed up beyond repair to the point where i cant even make small talk with people or have any trace of an actual personality. . . It hurts, so badly. Everyone ive ever cared about has either turned around and abused me or left me. I dont know what im doing wrong anymore. I dont even know if my life is as tragic as i make it out to be or if im just overreacting. It feels like everything is my fault and im constantly riddled with so much guilt and regret that i can barely function like a normal human being. . . This is long, i doubt it’ll be read by anyone and im, at this point, just looking to leave my story somewhere in case i do snap any time soon. I just want people to know i existed and it hurt. I doubt anyone i know irl will ever find this, i wouldnt want them to. But a handful of strangers who know my story will do.. . Cheers dudes, hopefully ill make it through this. And i hope anyone feeling similarly will too. Love you.",suicide
"i feel hopeless,..hello reddit, i'm not one to usually do something like this, in-fact whenever i had problems in the past i never tell anyone, opting to fix it myself, but this time is different. only here cause i need to tell someone,.. anyone how i feel,.. . . my problem isn't unique, i'm 18 and in a VERY religious household, mormon to be exact, and it is expected of every young-man in the church to serve a full 2 year mission, one which i have already been called and do not want to go. i decided i wasn't religious years ago after discovering i was bi, and have simply pretended to still believe for awhile because if i were to ever leave the church, me and my family would receive tons of public humiliation from our community, and theres a good chance of me being kicked out of my house. i have spent every night for the past few months debating the options in my mind, which are, . . 1) go to atlanta, georgia for 2 years and preach a gospel which i dont believe and disagree with,.. . . 2) face my biggest fears and tell my family the truth,... or 3, and the reason im on this sub,.. ending it all,... . &amp;#x200B;. . the more i think about it, the more 3 sounds like my only real choice,,.. theres no way i can serve a mission, i straight up refuse,.. but at the same time im not strong enough, im too weak to deal with the consequences of not going. the backlash of such a decision would be too much for me to bear, i would be a complete and utter failure/disappointment to my entire extended family and our church community.  i often hear my parents gossip about other families with less-than-stellar kids who have fallen away, they talk about how bad they feel for THEIR parents, and how ""disgraceful"" those children are, i shudder to think of the families in our ward around the dinner table discussing how my parents have failed and let me succumb to satans temptations,..  . . &amp;#x200B;. . i feel so alone. everything feels like trying to run in a nightmare, no matter how hard you try, and how badly you desire to move, you never get anywhere. all my irl friends growing up are either estranged, or also part of the church and wouldn't help me in any way. my best friends are all online friends who live states, and countries apart. ive told them of my situation, and nobody has the ability to help. . . &amp;#x200B;. . ive never even considered suicide as a real option for anything before,. but just thinking of either of the 2 alternatives id have to face, makes me sob uncontrollably,.. im too cowardly to deal with either. as much as i disagree with my family, i still love them, i cant stand to think of my moms face if she were to find out i left the church,. i think i honestly believe they too would be better off with my option 3,. atleast if im dead, they dont suffer judgment from their peers. . . &amp;#x200B;. . im only typing this here cause i have nowhere else to turn, i cant talk to my family about this for obvious reasons,.. i have nowhere else to turn. thank you for reading, im sorry if i made it too long",suicide

"I wish I wasn't like thisI never thought I'd work up the courage to post online but here I am I guess. I am simply a failure, I'm only 15, soon 16 but I am, I don't believe anybody who says otherwise. I was fine, about until I was 4 years old. When I went to daycare I could talk to the other kids perfectly, no trouble at all. When I started kindergarten, I remember going in with my dad and not wanting him to leave, that was always a problem for me, I got scared when my parents left me anywhere. It was different though, I just remember all the kids staring at me, it just did something. They were all just looking and ever since I became afraid of other people. I wouldn't even talk to anyone at the school, not even the teachers for a while, I just nodded or shook my head. I was very anti-social for a kid, I got mad when other kids went near me so I didn't make friends. I did in grade 1 and 2 somehow I guess, but they all moved away later. . . So I did my best at school, except for group projects, I couldn't speak and I always was afraid of being wrong and someone getting mad at me or about sounding stupid. I did really bad in math, I was good in english but only because I read chapter books instead of socialising. I also had pretty bad eyesight so I could never see what they taught on the smart board or chalk board. I bet my 9 year old cousin knows more about math than I do by now. I also might have adhd, my therapist thinks so but maybe I'm just lazy.. .  My depression started at about 9 years old after my grandma passed away from cancer. I know I could have done nothing about her death but what I didn't do is what caused my depression to start. I avoided her, I didn't say goodbye and I was a terrible granddaughter, I was afraid, sure but how could I have just let her die like that without telling her I love her? I will never forgive myself for that, that is the worst thing I did. I was such an asshole. She was the sweetest, smartest, kindest woman I have ever known and I was too much of a damn coward to say goodbye to her. . After that it all got out of control, I didn't care about how I looked, how I dressed, stopped taking care of myself, my anxiety got worse and life became way harder than it should be for someone my age, and it was my own fault too. My whole family is great, sure we have some fights but nothing like the things I have read on here. Yet I am too much of a coward, have too much anxiety, am too afraid to do a single thing. I wasn't the nicest person I guess, still working on that. . . Once in grade 5 or 6 I jumped off the school bus (before it started moving) and I had a fight with my dad, said some bad things, my anxiety was fear of looking stupid in front of other people and that is exactly what happened probably, I don't remember. Grade 7 sucked, I got diagnosed with ASD a year before and I had an EA (for the anxiety not autism) I tried being in classes but I couldn't focus, I was too afraid, the english teacher didn't really like me but the french teacher was nice. So it was okay but not as good as I wish it could have been. My EA changed schools the next year, I got a new one and she was nice but she just wasn't my old EA and I never got used to her, so I 'dropped' out. . . We tried online school but guess what? That gave me anxiety attacks and made me threaten suicide a lot, I wanted to, I just couldn't handle the pressure. My mom paid like 300 dollars or something and I was a selfish bitch. I can't handle anything. . . So I also have body image issues so I always made myself throw up when I felt fat, I was fat, I lost a bit of weight for no reason because I sure as hell didn't exercise anymore, 120-110 but I remember my dad saying before I was fat, not like he said it like that but it was implied, so I lost some more weight but I still feel fat because my mom always was obsessed with her diets and stuff, not targeted at me but I noticed and that was enough I guess. . . Grade 9 I did nothing, just lied in bed all day wishing I lived in the US so we could have a gun or that I lived in the city so I could jump off a rooftop. I could have done it on my other grandparents property but I would have ruined it for everyone so I will never do that there ever, it is such a beautiful place, I don't want to ruin it. Grade 10 is this year, but I guess I am still in grade 9, I am doing school work now in a few weeks but at home, feel bad that I'm in the same grade technically as my younger sister, that sucks but I am not good enough for grade 10, I mean I DID NOTHING ALL YEAR. . . I have always known I am going to kill myself before I am 35, I know that for a fact because I don't ever want to date or get married and my dad is in his 50s and I don't want my parents to die before me. I don't want to get old and get dementia or be bedridden so I have to die before that happens. Most people want something, I don't know what the fuck I want though. I don't want to be alone in this world, not at all. My family is all better than me, my mom went to university, my dad has the highest position at his job and he even had anxiety as bad as me, yet he can still do it and talk to people.. .  But I know I can't, If I had a job, I'd want to be some sort of farm worker because I know I can't do anything responsible that requires intelligence or being good at math. But I can't deny my body, I am a girl and only 4'11, I can't be strong, I've tried, trust me. I have helped my grandpa on his farm but still I'm not strong enough to carry a bucket of water more than a couple feet. I know women can be strong, but that is usually people above my height, so that doesn't help much. . . I just hate myself so fucking much. I want her to die, I don't even know, I just think sometimes how the hell am I this person, how are we the same, I feel like I have two identities, me and other me, like we're the same but I want to disconnect from her so bad. God I'm crazy. What is the point for people like me? People who break at the smallest of challenges, people with severe mental problems from birth, what do we do? How do I get better? I've been in therapy for two years, seen tons of great people and still I fail. Where do I buy motivation? I wish I could just order it online even if it were 2000 dollars. That is the issue, I lack motivation. . . Sorry, I know this is all over the place and too long, but when I get going I really get going. I am not good enough really, I am a failure to everyone. Why does everyone still love me? In my dreams my family always hates me but in real life they don't. I am just terrible. I've always been terrible. Terrible person, girl, student and no one ever hated me for it except for me. I wish I was dead, I want to go to heaven, I don't even really believe in god but if he is real I'd like to go to heaven and that stops me when I want to die, but someday that won't be enough, my dogs won't be enough, my family won't be. How can I live like this? In my room everyday, too afraid to try. I just want to try but I am so terrible, everyone probably despises me. I just want to let go. I thought if I was out of school I'd feel better but I miss it, I miss seeing people my own age, but I am too insecure, I won't go out until I feel skinny enough, have perfect straight hair, clear skin and nice clothes, I just can't go out until I like what I look like. . . I don't know why I am telling anyone this, I doubt anyone will read it or anything but if you do, I am glad that someone listened. I don't know when I will decide it is too much but I doubt I will ever have a life I feel is worth living for, someday I'll just be gone, in less than 20 years I am for sure. Everyone else is so great, they have careers ahead, intelligence, beauty, romance, friends, family, pets. I have some of those but I won't ever be anything more than this, I will never feel pretty enough or strong enough, I won't ever make another friend I can relate to and I will never be able to let go of this grief, I just wish it would end, god I want to be happy and just be a person again. Why did I fuck my life up before it even began? Thank you for reading.",suicide

"Got into cinema recently, and it is better than anime. Before you start breathing hard and start breaking your keyboard, read my post first, please. So I've seen lots and lots of anime (I literally have a freakin Senjougahara pfp). I was a person who gave up on movies, and only saw anime. Then, upon some recommendations, started watching some cinema and some regular tv series. I was reluctant at first, but started to quite enjoy it. Keep in mind here that I was only watching Hollywood. . . Then as I kept seeing more cinema, I finally got into international cinema. This is where I started to fall in love with cinema. One thing you need to keep in mind is that, anime is majorly only being produced by one country - Japan. Cinema is a global thing. Logically, one country IS NOT going to contain all the geniuses in the world. If Japan is able to produce so many amazing stories, just imagine what the rest of the world is capable of. . . If you're fed up with your country's cinema (I was too, Bollywood sucks ass), then it's time to start watching international cinema. Now before you jump on me saying that Inception is inspired by Paprika, let me tell you that Neon Genesis Evangelion is inspired by 2001: A Space Odyssey. Before you tell me that Black Swan is inspired by Perfect Blue, let me tell you that Ghost in the Shell was inspired by Blade Runner. There's no point in arguing guys, as many concepts Hollywood borrowed from anime, so did anime. And stop comparing it with just Hollywood guys, Hollywood isn't the second coming of Christ, there's so much more cinema made internationally that you're missing out on. After seeing lots of films, I am starting to appreciate manga more due to the more deep themes they tackle which many a times, anime doesn't. I like manga more than anime now. And of course films more than manga. . . Now you'll start telling me about bad acting, that's equivalent to bad animation. You can't relate to bad acting, likewise you can't relate to shit animation. Watch the good films. Now you'll say movies are generic, sexist. Stop, don't type a sentence more. Anime has sexualization of school girls too, now you'll say cuties, alright, agreed, but my point is, you have no right to speak about being sexist when you're an anime fan yourself. Also, cuties is one instance, anime bears many more instances. . . Let's talk about ""generic"". What's generic? A Harem? The same formula Isekai? The same formula shounen? Now, you'll tell me about Sakurasou, Mushoku Tensei, Re:Zero and Attack on Titan. And I can list many many more films that aren't generic and are VERY original. MCU isn't the end of the world, you're literally just seeing stuff that's popular and shitting on cinema, that's just dumb. See the good stuff, that's literally the difference between a good show and a bad popular shounen.   . . . Also, believe it or not, movies have more source material to adapt from, novels written worldwide are more in number than manga or light novels produced from one country. Also, there are people working on a film throughout the world, rather than majorly in one country. I am just stunned at the sheer amount of stories that are being told worldwide, if I just stuck to anime, I wouldn't have seen many wonderful films. And real women are much more beautiful than anime girls, ngl. . . It's just how you get 3 or 4 good anime a season, you get great films every year, and a stupid shounen can become popular, so can a movie. It's literally the same scenario, that's easy to understand, I hope. 3 or 4 films from an industry, 3 or 4 good series from an industry, put that on a worldwide scale and you'll be surprised at how many amazing stories you haven't seen yet! With that I put rest on the argument that I am liking cinema more than anime. . . Before you say it, yes, this post is a JoJo reference.",non-suicide

"I've had it...I really have had it with life: I am a 36 year old, severely disabled Multiple Sclerosis patient. I was diagnosed when I was 20 and from a life of sports and athletics, I have truly become a blob. I lost my job (didn't technically lose it, but retirement at age 32 is kind of losing it when your income is reduced to 1/3), I've been a complete loser with women or rather just waited or hoped for ""the one,"" but she never showed up and the ones I was eventually interested in turned me down so flat, oh boy. Hell, I was a virgin until 2 days ago, when finally I said ""fuck it"" and hired an escort. We went bare and I may have contracted something I don't know; I don't care. Not in any hopes of finding a lover or wife past this stage anyway. After 3 months of increasingly unbearable pain, I went to the ER and had an MRI taken of my back and the doctor said I may have a herniated disc, meaning surgery; meaning ""kill me now, please."" My sister had surgery on her back for a herniated disc a few years back and I remember how bad of a shape she was in post surgery that she needed 2 people to help her get out of bed to go to the bathroom and yet the hernia returned. I live alone, I have such shit neighbors that I even had to report the faggot shit punk bitch living upstairs to the precinct because he came down to my door, grabbed me by the collar and threatened to ""fuck me up."" 15 years ago, I would have broken both his arms, rolled him down the stairwell and just to make an example, violated that little fluffer he keeps around as a wife.

"I fucked it up with the girl I love.. Now I am going to die alone.So last month, I had posted on Facebook saying how I am going to be deactivating social media for a while and to PM me with numbers. My friend of 5 years who  I haven't really hung out much lately, but we have always been real close (kinda hard to explain, I think we all have those close friends we don't see often due to adulting) . Anyways, She messaged me with her number, asked how I was doing, and we started talking back and forth.. . A week before NYE hits, and I ask her if she doesn't have any plans,  I can put her on a guest list for a band we both like. I actually work for that band. It's a sold out show and I wanted to see her. . . Things were going good on NYE.  I got her a few drinks. We hung around each other the whole time. And she was the one following ME around. She gave me a few long hugs, told me she loved me (I assume platonically). But she was being very intimate. I assume it was due to the alcohol. . . The show was over at 1:30AM NYE, and I hugged her goodbye and told her I was going backstage. She asked if she could come, and I told her I wasn't allowed because I wasn't. . . I got home around 2:00AM that night and i sent her a text saying it was good seeing her and we should hang out, adding in there ""preferably tomorrow"". I think I may have came on too strong, but eh. I was drunk. And the message wasn't aggressive at all. Just really overly friendly. I didn't get a reply to it. But I would assume it was because she may have been hungover when she read it in the morning. (she may have been asleep or falling asleep when I sent the message).. . I sent her another message 7 days later about a mutual friends' art museam that they have opened up casually saying I am proud of them and they're doing well. And I asked her if she's been by there yet and I didn't get a reply.. . 3 days pass, and I started to get bothered. I was wondering if I doid anything wrong. So today I sent her the following message 9 hours ago: . . ""Hey. I just realized I may have been an ass by dipping out backstage at the end of the show. i just don't want you to think I was being a flake or didn't want to hang out. I'm sorry"" . . Now that text was maybe weirdly worded? I didn't dip out backstage early. I just kinda told her goodbye and went backstage at the end of the show. Which wasn't that big of a deal. But since she didn't reply I assume that she may have been mad that I didn't try and go somewhere after the show? I don't know.. . . . Either way. I was a selfish dick. And it's over. I want to fix it. I'd give anything to fix it. I love her. But it's over.. . ",suicide

"The mental health issues/OCD that I am struggling with for more than 4 years, I think it's time to put it out of my mind it might help I don't know what else to do I feel scared.(age 15) forgive me if I wrote it poorly english is my second language.I was scared for a long time to talk about these stuff because I thought it would stay in my head more longer to an extend of having to kill myself, I think that it must be a solution out of it, I am not gonna  give up ""just yet"".. . The first step I did was to search on google about my problem which I was afraid to do for more than 4 years also I wasn't sure it was a problem&lt;-- (still trying to fight it that it wan't a problem). So I googled it and I found out that it was similar to OCD. Here's my story:. . I was trying to be social accepted because of my friend group, one friend(D) was calling the other friends and me ""you have cancer"" ""noob""  ""\*\*\*\*rd"" ""\*\*\*pid"" and other bad stuff because we were doing stuff that annoyed him (like playing a game, not being as good as him in bikes in video games{fortnite/call of duty) and the other friends tried to be better/closer friend with him because he was like cool to them and they were thinking there was a problem with the rest of their friend group like I was thinking with my friend(T) at the time that he was keep doing the stuff that annoyed my toxic friend(D) this friend(T) was getting  more and more hate to him(T) that my toxic friend(D) calling him names like ""noob"" ""\*\*\*\*rd"" and ""you have carcer"" and etc. I was trying not be like my other friends/friend and tried to do things, to be more social, to be funny, etc so that they can like me as a friend. I devoloped an OCD, mental health issues that I wasn't aware of after more than 4 years than it was developed. Now I don't know if I am fully recovered from that but I am seeing some growth and improvement. Every day I wake up and I keep reminding to myself I can get recovered. I stopped any touch of communication with my friends and I can sae improvement with my mental health. . I am 15 forgive me if I said something wrong or if I didn't structured it not good enough to understand the situation. . I tried to make friendly advice smh I don't know if it's good enough(please be carefull with who you have become friends with if you feel like your friends are not good for your mental illeness maybe you shouldn't be friends with them chooce your friends don't let them choose who you are). .

I suffer mostly from the mental health aspect. Persistent severe depression, anxiety and PTSD. These things make it difficult for me to find work that I can handle, and keep. I'm finally getting some of the help needed, but its still pretty rocky. I forget to take my meds, and the homeless shelter pretty much renders most of my coping mechanisms worthless.. I'm currently waiting to hear back from a local training and rehabilitation center that will hopefully help me learn the skills I need to...just cope, and be a vaguely productive human being. They could call me tomorrow with an opening to get evaluated, or it could be months before I get an appointment. I'm also working with a few temp agencies nearby to try and find part time work that works with my mental barriers. Again, that could be tomorrow, or months.. To make things worse, I'm putting up my wonderful baby girl, the one reason that ept me out of this very same mental state, because I can't care for her the way that she deserves. I miss her so badly, but my mental health has gotten so bad that I can barely take care of myself, much less a child. There's a good chance I won't get to see her very much, or at all, once the adoption goes through.. . I always have suicide ideation. It's just one of the constants of my life now. Usually I can brush them off, but tonight...I'm so tired of trying to convince myself that life is worth living. To just make it through one more day. I don't want to die.. . Please, please, tell me why I should keep trudging forward. Please help find the strength for one more day.",suicide

"The Ultimate Diss You absolute piece of shit.. You absolute waste of space and room on the face of this Earth.. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic, doltish, dumb swine. You’re an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole. The magnitude of your hideous failure is so indescribably massive that throughout the future, your name will be used as a moniker of evil for heretics. Even if the human species put together their collective intelligence, there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did. The day Jesus died for our sins, He must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if He did, He would have forsaken humanity long ago, so that your birth may have never become reality. After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in museums after being scientifically researched, so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure. Because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you, will be degraded to a useless piece of shit. And a heavy burden to society. No wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you as a family member. Your birth made it so that mankind is worse in every way any intelligent brain can possibly imagine. You have made it to the point, where that society will never truly recover into a state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which  unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say, the apocalypse is upon us, but this is merely the closest word humans have, for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever  condemned everyone you love and know, into an long period of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell and doom. You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius, of a holy place, or a  place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted sac soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had, far beyond repair. You are an idiotic, shit-eating, dumbass, un-evolved Homo Sapien. And no one has ever loved you. Rhodes Island would have been better off, if you would have never joined us. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit, and all of us hate you with every single part of our being. The world’s finest writers, poets, and thoughtful philosophers from throughout the ages of Human history could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you have just fucked up. And how incredibly idiotic you are, words cannot emphasize.. Anyone that believes in any religion or deities, should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were reality, they would never have allowed a being such as you, to stain the Earth, and the universe itself.. For matter, atoms, and subatomic particles themselves, would be embarrassed to even reconfigure themselves in a way to form you and your dog-shit brain. In the far future, and for a very long time, our descendants will be writing horror stories about you. Which the scariest part of it all, is that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster has actually existed. You are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this Earth, yet you manage to make it so that, that is only a small part of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an eldrich abomination, but here you are. It is truly hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately, I cannot deny your existence. But I, even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you.. If any time in the future of our civilization, Time Travel is to be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time, to before this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors, if they failed would have to many mental, and physical drawbacks, that not even the bravest souls in the history of our species, would be willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry an infant for nine consecutive months and give birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to defend yourself with or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did. All nations on the face of this Earth would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have  shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws, irrelevant. Right from the moment I first set my eyes on you, I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on  . you, but it is clear to me now, that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event of such immense scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I  have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Past events like the plague, apparently happened with the goal of teaching humanity how to survive them. As the one you just created, not even mankind’s greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for  the insufferable evil you have just created.. If you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect the universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as monstrous as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single intelligent organism will ever want to come within a one hundred mile radius of you, and anything you have ever touched.. You are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and the entire bloodline. The dreadful mistake that you have brought upon us, is so harrowing, that anyone who will ever hear about it, would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear, and anxiety. They, emotionally and physically, would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of this world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown. I could sit here, and write paragraphs, essays, and books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently as possible, yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell, that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shit-show you have just released upon this world. You are an irresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who’s soul contains less humanity than every being in all history combined. The absolute disgust that I feel when thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have to do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great, that when I am honest about it, I think that even I do not posses a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own feelings about it. When the people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on subjects become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe.. My hate for you and everything that you stand for, is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala, that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate. And honesty, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that, that insult was low balling it such a massive amount, that all mountains in this world combined would have not been able to stack up this imprecise judgement in the light of the fact that when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless.. There is no one in this world that has ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, no one will ever love you in the future either. There is no hope that your stupid behavior and especially your crooked soul will ever change for the better. And in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the mistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will only devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible way in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is, would exclusively be because there is absolutely no conceivable way that you would even be able to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in. But than again, you are so incredibly abominable, that you would probably be able to surpass the worst conceivable failure a living being can possibly make. You are so incredibly pathetic, that you are honestly not worthy of any more of my words, nor my time, nor anyone’s time.. Just know that I will forever detest you for your failure, and everything you stand for, and that no matter what happens.. . I will never ever forgive you.",non-suicide

"Lonely drug addictI posted this in r/depression before but thought I'd post here too, it's long so thanks to anybody who reads this. . I'm a 23 year old male and I have never had a girlfriend. Iv had lots of beautiful girls flirt with me and text me, flirt with me at parties but iv always been too shy to make a move. I had sex once at a party but that's just cause this girl came on to me and I was so drunk I can barely remember it.Anyways iv been a drug addict for about 8 years, I've used marijuana pretty much everyday since i was 15(I personally consider weed a medicine as I need it to sleep), started getting into harder drugs at 16 or 17. For about the past year tho iv been using cocaine almost everyday along with mdma,shrooms, or anything else I could find at least once a week. Over the past year tho iv completely Lost my mind over a girl.. . Last summer this girl started texting me and flirting all the time .She asked me to fuck her a couple times but it was usually when I was at work so I couldn't just leave ,anyways she flirted everyday with me for like a month, and we hung out a couple times a week but there was usually other people around. long story short I enough made enough of an effort to get alone with her and make a move,I took to long so she lost interest after about a month since we started talking . The really stupid part is I didn't realize what I did wrong until way after the fact. Even all those girls I failed with in high school didn't make me realize that my shyness was making me come off uninterested. Although one night a few months after she stopped liking me she texted me saying she missed me and shit , but than next day she acted like she didn't mean anything by it. . I just feel like the most pathetic guy ever, like I'm subhuman I don't get how I'm that dumb but I was. Anyways though me and this girl are still to this day very good friends,kind of weirdly good,we see and talk to each other almost everyday and hang out often,sometimes for long stretches doing drugs,partying, we use drugs frequently together . For most of the winter me and her would do blow everyday hanging out when neither of us were working, we'd go to bars,restaurants. etc. . she even ditched her bfs to chill with me, for example one time me , her and her bf at the time (me and him are already kind of friends, small town)were driving back into town when she texts my phone saying to drop her off at home and let her know when I've ditched her bf, so as we approach town she just says I'm going home I got stuff to do. So after I dropped her off I dropped off her bf. She then texts me saying to pick her up and she wants to get some blow and do it with me. Which we then proceeded to do, she use to do stuff like this all the time. . she'll ask me to come smoke joints with her everyday at her work. Sometimes when we'd both be fucked up on something but weren't together, we'd spend hours texting each other back and forth talking about anything and everything. I can easily say she's my best friend, and I wouldn't trade her friendship for anything, I can't stand being just friends tho I love her so much, I connect with her like no one else iv ever met, she's even said to me herself that it's weird how much alike we are. .  I feel like she's my soulmate but I fucked it up. I've told her how I've felt about her a few times and each time she flipped out and said were only ever gonna be friends.which usually made me respond with really coked out stupid and desperate stuff, I cringe when I think about some of the stuff I've said to her.She knows how I feel about her yet She obviously enjoys my company still. This is all so painful tho cuz she's had 5 different bfs in the time since I started hanging with her. It makes me feel so pathetic since she came onto me so strong yet a couple of those guys were able to talk her into liking them eventually dating(even if was only for a month or 2. It's driving me insane, I think about it 24/7. I just got laid off from my job of 3 and a half years, convient timing because I drained my bank from buying so much blow. I have a couple buddies I chill with maybe once a week or every 2 weeks but she's my only real friend, even tho I have bigger problems I should be worrying about, all I care about is her.. . Even though she knows how I feel about her she still involves me in her life so much, I've told her how hard this is for me a long time ago yet she still always asks me to do something with her. I've tried just ignoring her before but when me and her aren't talking I get so depressed, and the longer we go without talking the more depressed I get.She's my only real friend so without her I feel so alone. In fact when I'm with her my mind finally stops thinking of her in that way because I'm just thankful to have such a good friend and I'd hate to lose that so i just focus on enjoying that aspect when we're together. . This whole thing is torture, I'm trapped in my own mind. I hate myself so much, it's all I can think about. I wish I could kill myself but I could never do that because  it'd devastate my family. I just can't stand how close I've gotten to this girl yet knowing she'll never be interested in me romantically again. I don't even get why she'd wanna see me so much knowing how I feel about her. This whole situation has broken my brain, the only way to distract myself is getting high which does help a bit But I never usually go longer than literally 5 mins without it crossing my mind. . I can't even watch movies,shows, or play games anymore because anytime something comes on screen that has to do with sex, relationships, or even just two people out on a date  that I start crying and turn my tv off. I just feel like  I blew my only one chance at the purpose of life and happiness. All I see on Facebook is people having babies, getting married, talking about how great and happy their life is. I want that :( I'm never gonna be able to have a family and that's all I want now.. . This whole things crushed my self confidence lower than it was before, I'm never gonna meet anyone because I'm such a loser, and now I'm too terrified too because I'm so stupid I'd fuck it up again and just have the same situation on my hands. I'd never be able to talk about this in person with anyone, it's far too embarrassing that I'd rather just pack up and leave without telling anyone. I'm sure there's no guy on earth Thats had as many really good looking girls start flirting with them first and never got wit any of them. I feel like the most pathetic excuse for a man to ever exist, I'm worthless and unlovable.. My personality is so off putting and just awkward. Being a mentally fucked good looking guy is the worst curse ever. . Am I insane to think this girl will ever like me? Obviously I'd have to be, i know she never will. I'm fucked tho I can't just block her number and never talk to her again because I get suicidal when we aren't talking,all I think about is how happy I could be if I just was a normal guy and was able to behave like one and made a move on a girl that was throwing herself at me practically. It sucks cause I'm so comfortable with her now I'd have no problem making a move. And have been comfortable enough for a while but it's too late, I'm fucked up and jus wish I could die. I think about it more and more everyday, it's consumed virtually every thought I have. My mind never lets anything go. I feel like all I can do is wait to die for this hell to be over. . I cry myself to sleep most nights, wake up to a txt from her, which perks me right up because she is my best friend after all. But then after I see her I get depressed about it and the whole thing repeats, day after day after day after day. . I just can't take it anymore,each line of coke I do I hope is the one that finally kills me. I'm a fuckin idiot and I can only blame myself, I've ruined my life.. . I know so much drug use will only make everything worse but at this point who cares? I wish I could die anyways. When I'm sober I spend every wakin moment thinking about it so I feel only things I can do is get fucked up on drugs to try to distract myself. . But I can't take it anymore,I just wanna die so I don't gotta think about it anymore. I know there's a million fish in th sea but i don't like people in general and most girls annoy me, but I just wanna die now. I've embarrassed myself so many times but I don care anymore about anything",suicide

"I've done something that ruined my life storyOk trying to make this as brief as possible:. . Mental breakdown around January last year. Went from an extremely heavy and skinny smoker who only ate garbage to a gym rat. Eating, eating, eating, 4000 calories of the healthiest food per day, becoming strong and healthy. Always hitting the gym. . . However: I get filled with regrets because the contrast is so huge. I feel like I'm about to die. Also get so fucking angry at myself and feel like the biggest failure ever. I mean... Who smokes!? Who neglects his health!? Only losers do that. Self-esteem below zero. Suicidal thoughts. Extremely depressed. . . I contact my ex to talk about it. Look up to her because she's 8 years older. I'm 28, she's 36. I start it off on the wrong foot with extremely negative texts like calling life pointless bullshit (fucking toxic behavior of me) she gets angry and I feel like I have to explain myself. She constantly says something I want to reply to and then blocks me so I keep making new accounts. One time she says 'you didn't change a bit and only went backwards' so I make a new account one last time to reply with 'but I did change'... Then she explodes. Writes a message to hurt me as much as possible and says she will never reply again. Says shit like 'you'll never learn how to live your life'... Saying that to me in my situation is pure poison for my brain. It's black on white and becomes engrained in my brain. Everything went wrong here. How I started it off with those negative texts and then tried to save it by continuing to make new accounts while my ex just wanted me to leave her alone. My ex also being unempethatic as fuck which makes me want to explain myself even more. Her ending it in that horribly cruel last message.... . After that it keeps repeating in my head every single minute of the day. I'm so frustrated and sad that she said that to me because it completely ruins my mental health and makes me feel hopeless while she doesn't know the full story. The only thing that made me feel proud of myself is how I've turned my life around, but that feels completely in vain after her last message. I can't cope with it and constantly write messages and delete them again only to write them again everyday explaining myself and apologizing. Telling her I know it was bad what I did. She never replies. After like 4 months of doing that shit she gets rid of her instagram 😓 I wrote a last extremely personal e-mail to her work, but she left that company so it got forwarded to her co-workers. Holy shit. . . Conclusion: I've turned into a stalker. Should I kill myself? I can't live with the embarrassment and shame... It's also not something I did in the heat of the moment.

Good morning fellow teens of Reddit! It’s 4:10 PM...  ;-;,non-suicide
":,)hello i’ve been struggling with depression and suicidal ideation since i was in fifth grade (im 16) and no one ever took it seriously until this year, when my mom finally took me to a psychiatrist and put me on meds. my psychiatrist has already increased my dosages for lexapro to 20mg, and also added wellbutrin and buspirone. i dropped out of school my second year because i physically could not handle seeing people or doing anything anymore. but i decided to go back to school this year because i was feeling a little better after seeing a therapist. two weeks into school, i’ve missed over half the days and suicidal thoughts are seeping in again. i found interest in an art career, i have a pretty good family (my parents were both physically and emotionally abusive since i was very young but got much better), a loving boyfriend, and a few trustworthy friends. yet i still feel hopeless and find no reason to go on.. . i’ve been told so many times by people that i have so much more to look forward too, that i’m too young, that it’ll break my loved ones’ hearts. but none of it matters to me. although i act kind and care about people around me, i know all of my internal thoughts. i know that inside, i’m completely toxic and awful and think the worst thoughts.. . i feel so bad for my friends and family because of how many times i’ve broken down, cried, told them i was going to die, etc. i feel like i’ve told them i’d kill myself so many times that no one takes it seriously anymore. and even if they do, i can sense them getting tired of me.. . i was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety, i’ve never had an official diagnosis for an eatinf disorder but i’ve been forcing myself to throw up and feeling guilty for eating since middle school. my mother also has depression, and i feel like shit because i know i’ve made it worse for her. my father is very distant and emotionally unavailable due to his experiences with abuse. both of them have told me to die, they’ve tried to kill me, thrown glass and ceramic at me, thrown me out of a car, and so on. my mom constantly threatens to kill herself whenever we fight. they only got better about a half a year ago, but they still go back to old habits from time to time.. . my boyfriend is extremely caring and sweet and protective. some of the things he does is questionable, though. i’ve asked for advice from my friends, because i sometimes can’t tell whether he’s being toxic or not. he makes me unbelievably happy at times, but i also cry and break down and want to kill myself because of fights with him.. . i don’t want my mom or my boyfriend to suffer from my death. i don’t want friends to be left with trauma. i don’t want to leave my lovely pets. but for some reason all of my pain and hurt overweighs all of them. am i a shitty person? or is this how a lot of people feel? am i being a stupid angsty teenager or is there a legitimate problem? i’ve always wished someone took me seriously and admitted me to a hospital or something. i recently quit smoking and i feel worse than ever. i’ve tried to kill myself and i’ve cut several times, but i always pussied out at the end. i take way too many painkillers and i dissociate constantly.. . i’m just vomiting up my thoughts after coming across this subreddit. i apologize for the never-ending post i hope none of you had to read throught this",suicide
"I don’t know what to do anymore...Right now I’m a little under 18 and I don’t know what to do anymore. I have very severe depression, anxiety, adhd, most likely ptsd, and possibly bipolar although doctor never confirmed but said it was definitely a possibility. Right now my life is unbearably bad. Every day is so grueling and bad I’m having a hard time not committing suicide. I actually have a small possibility to have a good life when I get a lot older but even then with how bad my mental condition is I don’t know if i could even enjoy it. After trying so many medications and going to so many doctors nothing works and the doctors can’t help and in a lot of cases don’t even care believe it or not. I’ve resulted in taking many drugs to try to cope and even psychedelic medicines which didn’t really work for my condition. I’ve thought of just committing suicide but I know my parents just could never cope and would hurt them to much. Every direction I look I’m totally f****d and see nothing but a living hell. The only thing that helps me handle my condition is canabis. For a while I would smoke a little through out the day and I would be able to think clearly and I wouldn’t go off the rails and my depression wouldn’t be bad but my parents busted me and are completely against it. ever since my life went back to being a constant living hell. I don’t know how long I’m going to be able to stay alive. If anyone has a idea on what I can do please tell me. These episodes are getting to unbearable to live through.",suicide
"I feel like therapy and medication doesn't help.I'm in college and have been seeing a therapist on campus and taking medication regularly for about 2 months.

"I used to live off self pity, but there's nothing less to pityMy 23rd Birthday is a few days away, and I feel more and more sick about it everyday. A few years ago I accepted I was a very unattractive person. I have a very weird face. It still hurt as I was the only one of my friends who had never had any kind of relationship with anyone. But it was bearable, because I could fall back on the 'It's not my fault I'm ugly, I'm a nice person inside.' and I could cry for an hour or so and move on, but I can't do that anymore. I've been told by lots of people I'm an aggressive, argumentative person. I have both a shitty appearance and a shitty personality. There's no 'but what about' thing to lean on. I spend most of my free time doing absolutely nothing. It just feels like there's no escape. Music is now just noise, nothing else. My old interest, History, has been sucked out of me. I have to force myself to pretend to be interested. I just want everything to reset and to let me figure out what went wrong. I haven't had a conversation with another person in nearly 3 weeks now. I just want to be alone, while also being lonely. I don't know how to describe it. I used to take long walks to clear my head, but they don't do anything, so I now just walk for 2 or 3 hours to exhaust myself so I can sleep. And I know this sounds pathetic, but the worst is when I see a couple while I'm walking, I don't feel angry or jealous, just sad. I don't even think I want to kill myself. The thought of my family's reaction to it means I'd never. I just want to sort of disappear. If the post isn't okay for this sub because of that, say and I'll remove it.",suicide
"I feel so useless and depressed for stupid shit reasons but I wanna ropeidk where I’m going with this at all, I’m just really really flustered and I feel like dying.. I’m not exactly the most mentally stable person, I’ve been depressed for years, it’s an up and down thing. Recently yesterday i felt so alone, even though I was with my friends, I felt like I wasn’t there with them, it was just my body that was. Just felt so empty, and lost. Fast forward to last night when I had a depressive episode and felt so lonely and wanted to make myself cry, I found the perfect outlet: reddit. i decided that the only way to make myself feel the shittiest I’ve ever been is to ask for rates. So I did, and I got one shitty rate saying I was way below average, which I honestly didn’t expect, but I achieved the goal of wanting to make myself feel like shit. After that I got some above average rates, but no I feel like these people pity me and my incompetence to have self esteem. I can’t believe I’ve reduced myself to a number.  I never cared about rates. From then on, I thought that small ounce of self esteem I had would still exist within me, but everything is gone. I feel like I’ve become socially anxious overnight. I stepped outside my house today and couldn’t breathe at all once I was exposed to people. Felt like an ugly contaminated piece of shit who is just contaminating the earth. A piece of shit that doesn’t deserve to live. I want to cry when I look at the mirror, and I’m dreading ever stepping outta my house, I just wanna rope , idk why I care so much about what people think about my looks, it just hurts a lot . I told my friends but ofc they’re my friends they would only try to reassure me that all this is true cuz then again everyone pities me and I honestly dunno where I’m going with this . Also I’m useless af, people who are my age (20) already have careers of their own while I am still a useless undergrad, my family makes fun of me for being fat though I’m not, I’m ugly I’ve been sexually assaulted idk wtf is another reason for me not to leave this world and finally be happy except for my kind bf who happens to be the only one who genuinely cares about me and what’s so “awesome” is he is in another country ",suicide

"I just came back from the doctor, it made everything much worseSo, I've been severely depressed since December. Things got bad last June though. I graduated college with a BA in Philosophy in May 2012, and have been unemployed since then. I had a girlfriend that I met at 19 (I'm currently 24), who was supposedly 28, unmarried, and a doctor. It was true that she was a doctor, but she was in fact 38 and married (to another doctor). I found out last May, and never said anything to her because I was shocked (so she never knew). In June, she decided to ""break up"" with me  At the same time, I was helping a friend get out of a relationship with another friend because she told me he raped her. Also around the same time, I had another friend try to kill himself and then disappear for 3 months because he was under ""watch"". Then I found out my grandmother had multiple brain tumors in September, and then I took care of her every single day (feeding her and changing her diaper, etc.) until she died in November while I was there (because I was the only unemployed person in my family). During this time, her stupid cat and I got close and she became my cat. Then in late December, the cat lost a ton of weight and then died in my arms from I have no idea what.. . It was only at the point that the cat died, that I started to think about suicide ... it invaded my dreams and every waking moment (it was the worst when I would take a shower). Things got really bad in March, and I had a knife to my throat and only stopped because my black Labrador retriever walked in. By this time, all of my friends from college have pretty much stopped talking to me, so I don't have a social support system. After this incident with the knife, I told my parents to set up an appointment with a therapist. We made sure the doctor was male because a female doctor would have made things worse for me (thanks to my ex). There was no one who could see me until today ... and I went in to the doctor expecting an initial therapy session ... and he only asks me for typical depression symptoms and then prescribes some medication. No real therapy, and at the end he decides to refer me to a female social worker. I live in Oklahoma, and can't seem to find anyone who will help without directly referring me to the ER.. . My mom (who drove me to the appointment) and I had a huge fight and I'm definitely feeling stigma from feeling suicidal and extremely depressed.. . So right now, the suicidal thoughts are really really bad (I really don't want to listen to them). But I fear going to the ER even worse because I'd probably have to talk to a female doctor.. . I should also mention that I've developed a pretty intense agoraphobia (I can't be in public without panicking). I can't look people in the face without feeling regret and disappointment over everything I've ever done.. . I have no idea how to handle this, and I apologize for the rambling .... . EDIT: I should also mention that I thought the girlfriend and I were fiancees.. . EDIT 2: I also used to be a pretty ""hardcore"" Buddhist following under a Tibetan Geshe ... but the last 2 years made me doubt things and I now no longer following that either.",suicide

I just want to be happy and healthy,  having a chance of living my life as I should be, but it's becoming too much for me,  I am not sure how I am going to handle the Spring semester back in college from my winter break. This uncomfortable depression is not letting me live my life to how I would want to improve.  I'm scared for my life,  I do self harm from time to time but it's not deep at all.  To say at the least that I don't think I can make it far this time.  I feel like my clock is ticking and the scary thing is that no one would have never suspect it if I was ever to have a problem at all. I'm anxious all the time, and I do get sad,  but I don't want to live this slow,  dark life anymore.  I want to be happy so bad and this time I ran out of ways of reaching out to anyone.  It's just me and God.  Only God knows what will happen to me.  Although all I can do is pray to God, but I am scared of what can happen to me as I wait for my prayers to be answered.  Yes,  I've tried talking to my family,  friends and mentors but they either say it is a phase,  or Just Seek God or I just have no reason to feel this way.

"Yes, I have been here before, another throw away.So I figure I should write a note. . . Rough draft. I have a little time to perfect it, but I doubt I see a new year.. ---. Dear people who knew me.. . I should explain. To many of you, this isn't a surprise but maybe a shock. To others you may not have had any idea. For years I have had to listen to thoughts guiding me to this moment. I have tried everything, the only thing that ever helped me was smoking marijuana, but that eventually due to other pressures could not lift me out of this. Just bringing that up some of you will jump to a conclusion that marijuana was a cause of my problems, not directly. Only the fact that it is illegal and I now have a misdemeanor possession charge that disqualifies me from having a job worth a shit does it affect me negatively.. . I don't remember my first suicidal thought. I must have been a very small child. When I was 10 I remember putting my dad's .22 rifle in my mouth and pulling the trigger. It jammed. I could never muster the courage to do it again. I tried. I would sit for hours in my room with that gun in my mouth crying, wishing a God would come tell me that everything will be okay eventually. That never happened and I turned my back on religion, I turned my back on any creator that would watch a child suffer so and do nothing to help. I would imagine God laughing at me. This made the rest of my Catholic schooling very frustrating. This was all happening years before I started smoking.. . I make it through high school only because I find marijuana. It has been the only medicine that has ever helped me silence the evils in my head. I have tried therapy and pills, none of that works, in fact it makes me feel worse. Something kept me holding on, maybe the stories that people would tell of how everyone hates high school and things get better once you get older. I held out through very tough times.. . After high school I spend a year or so really going crazy, doing heavy drugs, even trafficing heavy drugs. Not necessarily because I was making money, I just loved the prospect of going out ""suicide by cop"", I would never be arrested. This was a phaze, I left that world very soon after entering. Mainly because those other drugs didn't make me feel good like smoking marijuana did, they made my mind think more darkly than ever before. I tried to kill myself by overdose many many times during this year. At one point I wondered if I could die. Maybe I was the Highlander or some shit. For a few months I would sleep with a .25 pistol in my hand pointed at my head hoping it would go off in the night. It never did.. . At age 21 I escaped the prison that is the small town I grew up and moved to southern Florida. I had the time of my life, but when you have the time of your life you usually end up out of money, which is what happened. I was also severely electrocuted (I worked as an electrician at the time) and failed my UA (losing my job) but jobs in construction down there were everywhere I could have found work anywhere. I chose to fail and moved back home. . . A year later I get married. For a couple months it was bliss. Then I started to see that the person I married was not the person she portrays in real life. She was violent and abusive beyond anything I had ever seen. Not even in movies, not even on those shitty Lifetime movies where the drunk dude beats his wife then goes to the bar. I was stabbed numerous times, she would kick me in the spine without warning just for walking past her in the apartment (she did that Tae Bo shit, so she could kick hard) many times I would lie without feeling in my legs for 20 minutes wondering if I would ever walk again. She would just laugh. I believe she was poisoning me too, as the last year we were together I was sick all the time and as soon as we divorced that went away. She cheated on me many times, but would accuse me of having sex with every girl I work with and every girl in the apartment complex. I was not allowed friends.. . Basically, this was the craziest bitch I had ever known, and I married her. I told her all of my deepest, darkest secrets and she stored that knowledge as ammunition and completely decimated my being. She may not have physically murdered me (not that she didn't try) but she killed my soul. I could go on and on about how she is an evil cunt, but I don't want anyone to think she is the reason for this, nor do I want her to have that satisfaction.. . I wanted out almost immediately but she had become pregnant. I tried to do all the right things so that I could have a life with my kids. Eventually you just can't take being stabbed and kicked and hit with flying frying pans and you kick the bitch out of your house. I did this. I tried to get custody of my kids after she was FINALLY arrested for stabbing me in the head. She got a couple days of anger management and she got custody of the kids. Fuck you America for that one. My family is in huge debt because of me as well now.. . I love my kids very much, they are the only reason I have lived this long. I wish things could have been different for them. I wish they could have had a stronger father and a mother who isn't abusive. I don't know what else I can say, they are the greatest people in the entire world and they are still just little kids. I know they are going to be amazing adults.. . After the divorce I lost my mind. I honestly think I had like what POWs have when they are finally released. Just a super crazy post-traumatic disorder. I went on to completely fuck my life up. There is nothing left. Huge debt (six years of student loans), a drug charge that keeps me from getting even a shitty job I am overqualified for (from sitting on a park bench next to a guy who had a few grams of weed in his pocket at a campground), and a voice inside that tells me just about every 15 seconds I should kill myself. This is what I have left.. . I can't keep anyone interested for more than two weeks now. I don't even try anymore. There is nothing about me that anyone would want in their life. I do not hate the girls who have broken up with me in silence, sure it hurts to not even know what you did or why they won't talk to you anymore, but ultimately I don't blame them. I would do the same to me if I could, and basically that is what I am going to do now. I do not wallow in this misery in person, I have masks. I wear these quite well and I would always have fun with whoever I dated. We did fun things and I was always smiles and jokes. I am not a goth monster.. . All I have ever wanted was for one person to want me alive. All I ever wanted was for one person to want to see me everyday. The one time I thought I found that, all I was was a pin cusion. A punching bag. I couldn't even get the police to give a shit, they would kick me out of my own house for being beaten up ... with a warning that if I ever hit back I will go straight to jail. Fuck you America for that one too.. . Now if I found that person I would break up with them to save them from what my life has become, a black hole. No one deserves to adopt my troubles into their life. If I have to die alone, why wait? Right?. . Then the dreams started. Have you ever dreamed of killing yourself? I dream it almost every night. My mind wants me dead so bad. I call him my inside man. It's me, it's that guy that does all your hard math, does all your cognitive thinking. It's not some random ""hearing voices"" type shit, it's my mind telling me that I need to die. All the time. It's the first thing I think of in the morning. . . This is what I should have done when I was 10 and spared you all the trouble of who I became. I am sorry.. . ",suicide
"I don't live for myselfI have been suicidal since I was 9. Was sexually assaulted at 7, had a somewhat abusive mother, father left when I was 4, severe bullying in school and I was always surrounded by violence. I can imagine this will fuck anyone up. Well, everything since has been an experiment. I could care less if I am rich or poor, I just do things out of sheer curiosity and no disregard for what happens after. I committed lots of cyber crime when I was younger, I am surprised I am not in jail, but I am done with that. This all changed somewhat when I met my gf. When we met, she struggled with depression &amp; suicidal thoughts and I fought HARD to get her on track. She became my new project. I spent hours &amp; hours reading studies on depression &amp; tried to cure her. How ignorant of me to assume I can fix someone. Eventually she got on meds but she changed immediately after. I made a lot of mistakes during our relationship, but she became a different person towards me. All of the sudden, she started lying &amp; her true human nature showed itself. I wish I never tried to help her. She was the most innocent, loving girl in the beginning. My mental health took a bigger dive because of the pandemic, I became a drug addict. Even though I got clean, ""my depression"" became too much for her. So she left me. I know it's for the best, after all, who dates a person &amp; views them as your personal project. Still, I am very sad that I fought for someone &amp; they wouldn't fight for me. I did truly love her, still do, and probably will never stop. Now all of my old feelings are back. I can't think about programming or reading Marcus Aurelius. I just don't care. I tried only for her and her alone. I want to end my life now. I designed a perfect setup. 3 shotguns aimed right at my head, I even made the motor that will pull the triggers for me. But I probably never will. The only thing that prevents me from doing it is the thought that my little brother or my mother might find me dead &amp; will have to clean up my mess. I don't want to do it to them, so I live. I don't live for myself, I live for my close ones. If they all died, I would be very sad, but I would also be at peace since I would end my life shortly after.",suicide

"Boyfriend has joined my bullies.I don't know if I can cope much longer. . . I don't even know where to begin so maybe I'll bullet point everything.. . * My ex best friend has bullied me relentlessly for the past year simply because I ran against her in a club election (yes it's that petty). * Multiple times throughout this bullying I have been close to suicide. . * Throughout this bullying I have been going through constant hospital and doctors appointments to diagnose a chronic pain and fatigue condition. . * My boyfriend was there with me throughout this entire process and saw me suffering at the hands of my bully, struggling to cope with my declining health, and generally suffering. . * I unfortunately currently live with my bully, my boyfriend and a mutual friend. I cannot escape the contract that sadly ties me to this house.. . I cannot do this anymore. I just want to be hanging from the rafters. . . A few times now I have heard my boyfriend (we've been together for approximately a year and a half now) bitching about me to my bully. Full on berating me to her. . . He's seen what she's done to me and how she has made me feel and yet for some reason chooses to give her more ammo against me? Bear in mind that the bitching is about pathetic couples arguments that are literally meaningless. The last bit of bitching he partook in with my bully was about how I didn't want to go and see the Superbowl with him because my health was bad after being at university all day so I just wanted to sleep. . . I can't even put into words how isolated I am feeling. He spends more time with this bully than with me and I've mentioned this to him - oh believe me. But for some reason he just gets annoyed with me that I even point it out. Why am I in the wrong for believing that you should probably support your girlfriend before the person that LITERALLY BULLIES HER TO THE POINT OF SUICIDE. . . . And yes I know that everyone is always like ""leave him"" - I agree, he's not worth a minute of my time anymore. However I literally have NO ONE ELSE. Her bullying isolated me from every one I ever called a friend. I am alone here at university away from my family and he is all I have. . . . I honestly just think it is best if I were no longer here. I don't know how to cope anymore. Perhaps I should just get some emergency housing to be away from them all - but then what?

"that’s it folks.i had to make a new account because i’m not trying to get attention or sympathy - i’ve come to an agreement with myself that i’m going to be killing myself next year. i’ve set savings and goals to pay off my debt before i go so my family doesn’t have to worry about it. i really have nothing to be sad about but i’m still sad. i have a loving girlfriend, a kind and patient family, lots of friends and a good job. i don’t know why i’m so sad, i have this constant hollow feeling inside me and not very nice thoughts in my head, things i’ve done in the past, the pain i’ve caused for others. i guess with these thoughts, i’ve justified and decided that the people around me are better off without me. i’ve tried opening up to really close friends but every time i try to do it, it feels as though i’m bringing them down with me or i’m seeking attention then i end up feeling worse. i’ve gone to a therapist but hey, i’m still here. though with this finalization, i feel at peace? i feel like i don’t have to try so hard, i’ve become more patient with everyone around me and loving because in my head, this is the last year i’ll be spending time with them. some things i will miss, the sound of her voice when she wakes up in the morning or from her naps, her laugh, her eyes when she smiles, her future thriving. my sisters teasing me, my sisters starting their families, my niece and future nephews and nieces. my friends having families and becoming successful like i know they will be. my children from work growing up, my coworkers. my cousins growing older and living life. i don’t have the best relationship with my parents but i will miss them. i know a year of posting this is a long time, a lot can happen in a year but i’ve been thinking about this for a long time now and i really don’t see myself living longer anymore. i’m sorry if this finds the people i care about - i really tried. so september 23rd, 2021 will be my last day and you guys will most likely see my final post the day before. i’ll send my apologies then. maybe life isn’t just for everybody, maybe i’m just really tired.. . i hope you all get better and find love while you’re here.",suicide

"Literally do or dieLately I've been telling myself not to give up on suicide. I've had attempts, and I've been afraid of failing, like most of us. . . . . I'm an alcoholic, and I can't stay sober. I need to try harder, but it still might not be enough. I took out student loans when I was drinking. When I was sober, I knew I was too much of a shithead to be able to deal with loans responsibly, so I paid for school by working two jobs. Now no jobs, no school, interest creeping up daily. . . . . Even if I manage to quit drinking for more than a week and actually get involved in AA, then what? I've always been poor, and now I'm poor with debt, probably terrible credit, an extra 50lbs on my short frame, and no one that thinks I'm a bright teenager who needs a break. I'm scum. I'm the reason employers don't like to see a gap in work experience on resumes. I have no one I can talk to because I was awful to them. I had the most amazing relationship of my life, and then the worst break up. I can't even begin to get over it. If I knew this would happen, I would have killed myself when I was a teenager. . . . . Similar things happened to my mom. Three husbands kept her from becoming homeless, but she's miserable. Drinks secretly, made herself disabled, abuses whatever pills they'll still prescribe her, does nothing for months until she gets bored and does something horrible and insane. She's always been like that. . . . . So I can't give up on suicide. I can try to make my life better, but I know how often I've failed, and better might not be good enough. I think my mom knows she's done living and has for decades. She's just kind of waiting until her luck runs out. I am too, but I can't anymore. I'm afraid of hurting more people. I need to remember that suicide is not just an option, but a necessity after a certain point. Maybe I'm already at that point. ",suicide

"Writing an essay every week until I'm better at it (week 2) Title: Water. . Water is an odorless, colourless, tasteless, inorganic liquid and is the main constituent of the earth’s surface and all living organisms, as far as we know. It is vital to the survival of all known living organisms even though it has no calories or organic nutrients. Potable water is rare compared to all water present on our planet and may be dangerous to humans when consumed in large quantities as it causes the sodium content in our blood to become diluted. Another danger that can be attributed to water is drowning where the lack of oxygen going into the lungs  becomes dangerous and possibly fatal, an experience that can cause a profound fear of water, especially to a kid like Jon.. . The weather at the beach was ideal, the seawater was clear as the water in his bottle and the sand was a golden liquid. After setting up camp on the mostly empty beach, Jon and his younger brother went to change to an outfit more suited to swimming. His parents had told them to use floating boards but Jon had already planned on the opposite, for he lived near the beach and believed he was old and skilled enough to swim without aid and had only given it to his younger brother. Then they went to the water and started playing. The salty water was cold and refreshed them, washing away the fatigue they had gathered throughout the week. The salty air was crisp and carried with it the smell of fish. The coast sloped gently and was safe even for children as far as people knew.. . After an hour, they had started getting tired from all the playing and wanted to do one last thing before they left for home, that is, a breath holding contest, for his brain had only wanted one thing then- fun. And so, They went away from the beach to a place which was considerably deep but still shallow enough to touch the ground if he really tried and so that was what he did, for the only thing he wanted at that time was fun and a challenge that sort had seemed fun at that time. On the second round, Jon had dived deep and buried his feet into the ground without much thought of what might happen. But when he tried swimming back up, he felt that his foot was stuck in the sand like he had stuck his foot into jelly.. .  ‘Oh no’ thought Jon. He tried pulling his foot out but it would not budge. He shook his foot right and left and that moved his foot a bit, but he did not have the time. His brain was in full panic mode and had shut off all his senses except for sight and feel, not that he could smell anything anyway. His full focus was directed at pulling his foot out. Suddenly, he felt his lungs burn. The carbon dioxide content in his lungs had started to burn his insides. He wanted to breathe, no, he had to breathe but he could not. He opened his mouth to scream but he shouldn't. He shook his foot frantically. The corners of his vision were turning dark and he felt every beat of his heart. His body was hot, warming up the water around him. He felt the hot stream of blood rush to his brain and limbs, trying frantically to feed his brain oxygen or what little he had left in his lungs. His legs were tired, his arms were tired, his lungs were burning up and in a last attempt to survive, he had started breathing in water. Now instead of his lungs burning, they were itchy and he coughed up what little air he had in his lungs. Now, his vision had become dark and grainy and he felt weaker and weaker until,. . He awoke to the beach, his mind empty. He coughed and finally breathed in what he was supposed to breathe. His brain switched itself on and coughed up most of the water left in his lungs. That was when he remembered what was going on. Whatever happened after that was a blur. He found out that it was his brother who had called someone to help him when he saw his brother struggle underwater and lucky for him, There was someone else near them and Jon was saved before it was too late. . From that day on, Jon stayed away from water and only went in if he absolutely needed to and tried his best to not get carried away in the moment as he had that day.",non-suicide

"TodayToday I made justifications for my reasoning behind wanting to eventually depart from the earth. In those moments I realized that a certain area within my very being showed a basic human response or feeling. I felt as if I had enough suffering and I didn't want to continue living anymore. It was reflective of a form of innocence in my reasoning. Every day I go through extreme emotions. I come to the fact that my inner rage will never go away as long as Im living. I can't and will not have a mind that is sadistic and drowned in an ocean of rage. I often believe that this feeling of wanting to die started yeara ago. Funny how i promised myself that I would never attempt. Low and behold I tried twice this year. The first attempt i felt leaking inside my head and had a weird smell coming from my nose. The second time I should had died but after ingesting over 50 pills i woke up about 15 hours later. I belive I was trying to do the right thing and save myself from my never ending torture chamber called my life. I tried a weird way of hanging but got tired. Then last week I sniffed carbon monoxide from my car's exhaust pipe. I been so obsessed with death and suicide. I researched on many suicides online. I read the biographies of those who checked out. I see the open casket pictures of those who killed themselves. I read quotes on suicide. I had dreams of me killing myself. I remember before my attempts i was starting to fall asleep and I thought death was on its way so i spread my arms out and waited. It was beautiful in a way. Im naturally suicidal everyday and it does take a toll. Today for a few hours I experienced a mysterious feeling. It was essentially good but it didnt start from the heart nor mind. Somewhere in my very being it generated. While in this type of feeling I didnt feel guilty, sad, depressed, suicidal, homicidal, feeling sub human, or paranoid. It was as if this feeling was a natural aid. I didn't have to do anything in order to experience it. It came from its own terms. It was almost as if this feeling was unconditional and with no requirements. It wasnt soley happiness but happiness was there in a very pure like form. My thoughts were suddenly slow and barely coming in with no adverse reactions. I felt peaceful but I was sad later on because this emotion was fading away. Ill wake up tomorrow and feel avoidant,suicidal, depressed,homicidal, paranoid, insane, and all the past traumas will be there waiting to haunt me. This Sunday I might inhale some more carbon monoxide or try something with a bag. I dont know. On the 15 is my psychiatrist appointment but i dont want to wait that long. I just want that mysterious feeling back and just to swim in it and never depart from it. Tired of being human. I dont need to be eternallu condemned or raked through the proverbial coals here. I need peace. I dont need advice or better thinking habits. I dont need a girlfriend or a message from God. All i need is the mysterious feeling . I miss you so much.",suicide

"Stuck. I'm just finishing my second semester of my freshman year, and I feel like I really fucked it up. I guess anything could happen at this point, but I don't foresee getting good grades (I probably won't even get a 3.0). Getting hired as an educator requires that I put myself ahead of everyone else, and even if I do well my next three years this will follow me and could hurt my chances of getting hired. I guess this isn't my main worry, though - I'm scared that if I can't change the way I live, I'll never amount to anything and I'll disappoint my parents and everyone else. I have literally no motivation. none. At this point, it takes massive amounts of effort to even get up and go to class. It's not like I don't care. I'm stuck in this cycle of not being able to do anything and then hating myself as I fail.  . I also came to the realization this semester (it was actually a while ago, but now I'm just starting to accept it) that I'm going to be unhappy in almost every relationship I ever have. I feel like I might be a lesbian, which a lot of people in my life wouldn't approve of/be disgusted by. And I don't even know if I AM gay. I just feel so  confused and lonely. I want to be able to be with someone that makes me happy but I have no idea if that's even possible.. I'm absolutely stuck right now.

"Suicide pact time: I will commit suicide a year from . know if my life doesn't improve.I made this same pact to myself when I was 18: if my life doens't get better by the time I hit 25, I was to commit suicide. I am 25 now and realize this is just as ""good as it gets"" in the way that it's only going to get worse from here on out, and this is one storm not worth whethering.. . If I don't have a quality girlfriend, and two closish friends, within one year, I'm just going to end it. I can't tolerate this loneliness anymore, and with the world being cheapskate city I feel like I owe it no loyalties.. . ""Hang in there,"" is what I have tried, and I already feel like I've experienced the last vestiges of what life has to offer beyond the endless sea of torment under the waves. I no longer enjoy life, people are beneath me, and I feel like I've been placed in the wrong age. Suicide seems reasonable in a year's time if nothing improves.. ",suicide
"Back again. I tried last night, but threw up the pills. I ran away from the hospital angry that I am still alive. My GF of 10 years is gone. My family mostly hates me. I have no friends. No job. I can't even afford to get a replacement drivers licsense. I'm waiting on umemployment and living in a halfway house where everyone is drinking or using drugs. I've tried to see a light at the end of the tunnel, but I can see nothing good about my life. It's almost unfair to ask me to endure this pain. I'm in such a hole and I have no way out. I'd move out of here, but I am broke. I'd get a job, but I have no ID. I can't even afford fucking bus fare. My GF is seeing someone else and my heart is broken. I've never in life imagined a person could hurt so deeply. Nobody really cares about me. I'm all alone and the only thing I can think of is how great it would be to not feel this way. And no amount of alcohol or drugs can fill that void. It'd be better to be dead. Christ, I can't even go out in public without wanting to cry and hide. I'm stuck in this foul house, with foul people and nothing to look forward to, except a non-stop montage of thinking about my ex, and the life that I lost. I'm crying so hard right now. I can't take this. I've had three serious attempts in the last two months. I think my next one will finally do the trick.

As an entity I feel like I want the opportunity to completely disappear from the planet and cease to be. To not be involved at all with life and just exist in this silent, quiet place where there is nothing. But at the same time, when I think of suicide, it feels almost over the top for my situation. I have no right or reason to feel how I do and that drives me crazy. I have everything going for me but I really just want to disappear.. .

Or if the signs I think I’m reading are superstitions, if you understand what I’m saying.. . I am a 15 male, almost 16( January) she’s a 14 girl, close to 15( may). . . Ok. So when I’m around her, she’s very playful with me, we make jokes, and sometimes she’ll poke fun at me. Not in a mean mean way but as a fun way. Last time I saw her, we got lunch together( we work at the same place) the entire backstory I’m willing to share will be at the end of this, I’ll indent it for people wanting to read it first) I didn’t pay for it, and I’m still kicking myself for it, but back to it, we talked a lot and generally we get along really well. The second time ever we worked together we talked about the fact that she loves Taylor Swift, and how I used to like Taylor Swift( yes I’m a guy, but it was when I was like 9) ok, here’s the backstory.        . .       Ok so around summer 2019, I was volunteering at the local museum, I’ve been doing it since I was 13, it’s a nice place. And I work with a lot of girls. The place has a Lego station where the kids can be entertained while the parents rest, and I usually ask to work there because I’m good around little kids( I still haven’t found a better way to word it so I don’t sound like a pedophile but) but yeah, I work with a lot of girls. But when this girl and I were assigned together, we clicked. We got along so well. We had so much in common, we talked basically the whole time to each other. And right off the bat she would make jokes about me. Like I made a lego sword. Really cool. And so the kids would ask to see it, my sword( oh gosh, gotta figure out how to word that better too) and the girl would joke about how she made it and then would be like I let him( me) borrow it. Throughout our entire banter I probably had a lot of “sword” jokes that I missed out on, but anyway yeah, she’d make jokes, I’d make jokes. We had great chemistry. So, I, never ever have I been that brave, still now. And I’m glad I did, but I decided to write her a note on my last day volunteering for the summer, unfortunately she wasn’t working that day, and I wouldn’t be working again. So I left a note saying if I remember correctly “Hey, here’s a sword, you can have it. We get along really great and I would like to keep in touch as friends, here’s my phone number.  So about 2 weeks later she texts me and is like, hey I’m really sorry but my dad is really strict and doesn’t want me dating boys. Hope we can still be friends though. And so I responded, oh that’s fine. That wasn’t my intention anyway. I just wanted to be friends. So we’ve been talking by text since then. I had seen her twice after that. Once for a Octoberfest the museum was doing. We got along great then too, I bought her a donut during that. I have adhd and usually I take medicine for it, but I forgot all about it that day. And so personally I felt like, now looking back, I was a little clingy. But she seemed fine with it. The last time because of Covid I saw her was in January, we did a winter thing at the museum. Personally I think that was our best interaction. We had lunch together, we were at the same place, I got a snack and asked if she wanted one, she said no, and I ate my snack but she wanted some so we shared a bag of fruit gummy/ snacks, to be exact. Since then we haven’t seen each other in person. We’ve been texting, I talk to her every day. Every holiday we talk. No phone calls though. Ok now about her( what I know). . . -Shes very Christian. I’m nothing really, however I have cut down on my use of Jesus, Jesus Christ, and oh my god, to jeez, and oh my gosh recently( probably because of her). - her parents are very strict.. - i know a lot more about her, but I doesn’t apply here so it’s not important. An important thing I didn’t mention. A month ago I asked her if she wanted to have lunch together sometime, as friends. And she said she can’t, her dad wouldn’t let her. She said she wanted to though. Whether or not that’s true is not for me to contemplate.. So basically I’m very sorry about this entire essay. When I started this I didn’t plan on this but maybe I just needed to right this all down. My question is does she like me. I know this isn’t a lot of info to figure that out. So maybe put common signs that you think she’d do. I don’t know. Just what do you think about this. Thanks. Merry Christmas. Also I’m sorry if you just saw this from a different account.

"Why do so many of us want to die?I might be asking on the wrong subreddit but I also have suicidal thoughts. My reasons are probably way less severe than any of yours. I feel worthless, That I have nothing to contribute. No special skills or talents, no interest. No one needs me since they have others. I can't study since I hate myself so much and I can't find work unless I get a degree in something. The competition for low-end jobs is tough since even those need certain degrees. I still live with my mom when most others live on their own. She is a bit tricky to live with. I don't think she is noticing how bad I feel. She wants me to do more when I already feel like I'm at my limit. I wrote a will yesterday but I haven't decided yet if I'm gonna do it or not. Sorry if it's not convincing. I get that. It's just another thing that I'm apparently worthless at. . . So what are your reasons? . Hope I'm not breaking any rules. I'm only asking for the reasons not the methods. ",suicide

"“I’d rather hear the same thing 100 times than go to your funeral”No you wouldn’t. Sure you don’t want me to die, but eventually you realise mental illness isn’t a cute quirk but more a living hell. As soon as the person you’re listening to acts in a way you don’t like you stop listening.

"Just been feeling really down lately.So, I don't really know how this works but I'll give a bit of a back story. . .  I've had a sort of rough life? Not really the hardest but not the best (who really has?) but my life was rough due to drugs. . My Parents have had serious drug problems my whole life and most likely before then, they use to do meth but quit and started doing Xenex and hydrocodone really bad. By Bad I mean taking an excessive amount (10+).. . . Any drug habit takes a lot of money especially at $5 a pill. So that led to my parents constantly being broke which meant no food in the house, so we went several days without eating. So that sucked pretty bad and lead to me and my brothers hating drugs with a passion. . Well, as I got older my brothers moved out and I was left to deal with doped up parents to the extent of them falling, drooling and extremely slurred speech. .  . One night when I was at work my mom went to jail (doped up driving) going to pick up more pills because they were running low. That night my father Called and told my brother go pick me up and take me to my Grandma's, But I was already heading home by that point. I got home found out and my Father was fucked up, like normal. I just kinda just went to my room and went to bed. The next morning I had school, well he apparently got more fucked up over night so that pissed me off. I raged, said hateful things and just was all around pissed said things like ''this is fucking stupid get your fucking life together'' to my father and other hateful things. .   He drove me to school that morning (My car wasn't running and the night prior my girlfriend at the time drove me home from work)  . . As I hopped out of the car he said ''I love you son'' and I just slammed the door in his face, well later that morning my oldest brother came and picked me up early from school. I knew something was wrong and he just said ''Dads dead''. I broke down and Cried.. . It's been about three years sense this happened and it's seriously been bothering me lately, everytime I drive I think about running off a bridge or running into a piller because I feel like such a piece of shit. . .

"I wanna kill myself because of schoolSo I'm 14 and in 8th grade and I wanna die. So for some backstory: I've always been an okay student. I've only gotten A's in like 2 subjects, in others I usually passed with C's or E's. I didn't have many friends but I was on everyones good side, my absolute best friend went to another school but that's fine, we hung out on weekends. I attented every lesson, ate lunch everyday, respected my teachers, and despite being shy I tried to raise my hand and answer questions. I also kept my hands off my phone most of the time. Everything was good. Then when I started 6th grade it started to get worse. I still had all my friends and my family life was normal, but I felt slightly sadder than before, and less motivated. I started to be late more and halfway through the year I stopped eating lunch. I was also getting distracted way easier and started using my phone more. I still did my best though, although my best abilities had decreased some. In 7th grade, it really just crashed down. For no reason I stopped attending certain classes, specifically math and art. Did I mention I never really liked math anyways? Naturally, I started failing in these subjects. Of course this was dumb but I just kept skipping more and more classes, eventually I stopped going altogether. I've always been a night owl but I started taking it to the next level: I fell asleep at like 7, the time I was supposed to wake up. Nowadays my sleep schedule changes every week. I barely go to school anymore. I'm failing every subject. My brother is calling me lazy, my parents are understandably dissapointed in me. The only friends I have are my online friends who I honestly owe my life to, I love them like I love my mom. Sometimes my classmates ask where I am and I just say I'm sick. I know they don't believe it but wtf should I say anyways. Yeah I think that wraps it up, my life is going downhill and I'm not doing anything. Please help",suicide
"My mental state is declining.I don't know. I'm going crazy, I've been depressed for so long and it keeps getting even worse that I don't even feel like I'm depressed anymore it just feels like a normal everday sadness now. It feels like I'm driving drunk, and at any moment I'm going to take a sharp turn off the road and smash into a tree and die.. . Some moments are ok, some moments I'm chill, but most of the time of the day is filled with either feeling absolutely nothing, and sudden urges to just end it all spring up at the most random of times - just the need to kill myself right that instant, even if Im in the middle of work my brain just tells me to end right away any I can no matter how it happens. The mood swings are randomized and acknowledging it makes me feel even more crazy. . . I want to die though I'm to much of a baby, but when these urges happens it takes everything in me to not step out in front of traffic or take all the Tylenol PM. I've dealt with this for years but now its all falling down around me.

That means that I'll get a lecture about how everyone else hates me and they're all going to laugh at me because I look stupid and I'm fat and I'm never going to get a job. . .

"I don’t feel like anyone listens to meThrowaway for whatever reason. Idk. I guess I still feel the need to protect myself in some sick way. . Yesterday, I posted the following text to a group of close friends: . . &gt;	All my life I have dealt with the idea that I should not be alive.. Unfortunately, this fact leads many to believe that I actually have dealt with it. That surely by now I would have decided one way or the other where my life went.. People also tend to think I have talents somewhere. Maybe singing, maybe teaching, maybe writing (I think you can tell that that one’s not the case), just some skills somewhere. This is not, and has never been, the case. I am a complete failure in everything I do.. Apparently, I am also a failure in depression.. Ain'tcha proud of me ma?. Unfortunately for me, all of this failure is hidden away. Maybe I say something about this whole “wanting to die” business in some secluded channel. Maybe I mention it during a song I’m singing, and so I can hide behind the old “well I’m just singing it how it was written” excuse favoured by those white people at rap concerts. Maybe I hide it behind these “charming” jokes. Regardless, it all gets hidden.. Why that’s unfortunate is that people then take my hiding of it to mean I don’t deal with it at all. Instead of seeing the sniveling twerp who might shatter at a particularly loud cricket that I am, they view someone who has dealt with their problems and can be strong for them.. I have become the constant listener. People appreciate that I listen and respond to their needs, their venting, what have you. Because people appreciate this, I feel validated. That validation feeds this whole perpetual motion device to where we are today where some expect me to be an active participant in their lives, yet I have to threaten going through with “it” to get any response. Even then, it’s never a sure fire thing.. And I get it. I give off this vibe, it’s no one's fault that they view me this way. Besides, haven’t I ever given a thought about what they think of the whole situation, I should really learn to be more considerate.. In some ways, it doesn’t matter anymore. It’s too late. I feel the crushing need to help people at all times by now, so nothing will change that. But it hurts when people take this as me saying I feel unwanted. It’s not that. It’s that I feel like the teddy bear taken out when the storm gets rough outside, I feel like the friend character in a movie who centers themselves around the main character, never to do anything, anything, that does not affect their lives.. I feel isolated in the center of crowded rooms.. I’m stuck in this constant need to tell people something, while also not hurting them by saying it, while also not wanting to be that open to them. It’s a deadly bermuda triangle built on a rough sea of self loathing. And there’s no way out from what I can tell. I’ll always be stuck here. Not this physical place. I will always be stuck as these words on a short page when the human me almost shattered for good. The person who wrote these words is stuck in the past, unchanging, and because of this, the person you will later speak to is exactly as stuck.. The truth is that I was rigged to fail from the start. Depression isn’t current sadness keeping you in your bed. Depression is the long ago faded pain which kept you in bed, and will keep you in bed so long as you have it. Depression is never about the present, it’s always a past thing. And I’m still stuck in the past.. If you value anything I say, never worry for me. That is as good as calling me dead. If you want to help, just listen. Thanks.. . Today, when the first and so far only person to respond actually said something to me privately, they asked if this was a suicide note. I said no.. . I guess I wasn’t exactly lying. I don’t plan to kill myself now, specifically. But there is something there. The lack of response to this, literally just one person, only tells me my fears are true. If it seems only one person will care about my suicide, why shouldn’t I do it?. . Idk why I’m putting this here, or what I’m seeking to find.",suicide

"A message of hopeThis is a message for you, for those who are still fighting, for this struggling to hold on, for those who needs to believe. I am going to share the stories of my own, and I know this will be helpful because I’ve been here before. . . I tend not to share to much with strangers, but I know you are brothers and sisters fighting the same war.. . I grow up being rejected from most people, as friends and even with girls. Everything stoped when I stoped trying so hard, I was true to my self, and now I have a lot of friends. But yet still I felt like too much of a coward to ask any of my crush out, judging on my looks and experience. Every night is like a torture to me, I would...well seeing that we’re here...pretend to have a gf, and we all know how that goes. Any chance to a relationship to a girl I would grab on, but most of them ended up rushed and creeped out, I am not proud of that. I was devastated.. . And then one day, I met a girl at this camp, it was only two days, so I guess I could pretend to be someone that I’m not, for some odd reason, I was one of the guys, if not the guy that has all the girls attention. I was funny, nice, and confident, I didn’t have anything to lose, and being at the wonderful camp, there’s zero time to think about how miserable I was. Anyways I was able to impress most of the girls, but there was thins one girl that I took particular notice. She was very nice, cute and probably the funniest girl I’ve met. So I asked for her number, and we talked after camp was over, funny enough, she asked me out (not dating) I agreed, though she lives on another island. Things escalated, and three days after I asked if she wanted to date me, and she said yes. . . She was everything to me. Everything. Though she’s really, really busy being a school model, swimming, band, and everything else, we still talked everyday, through FaceTime or just texting. And being the guy that was lonely for his entire life, I naturally put too much into her, too much to pull out. One day, and I mind you this is shortly after, she told me that she can no longer bare it anymore, she couldn’t see me because of the the time, the distance, and her parents. She said that she could bare not seeing me anymore, and that the pain is effecting her life too much. I was completely horror struck, that night was the worst night of my entire life, I’m pretty sure I was suffocating, it’s like there’s a expanding metal ball in my chest, I thought of killing myself. But I held on, because of a promise that I had with God, I told him that I would hold on because I know that I can trust him, that he answered my called when she came into my life. Still I struggled, we became just friends, and after a while things seems like it’s going to be bearable. Until one day I crossed the line and suggested to be together again. That was the biggest mistake of my life...she blocked me out completely.. . It’s been a while now, for most of the time was pretty much normal, infancy better now that I don’t do desperately want a gf, but this whole quarantine business...and this video... let’s just say I was constantly reminded. But even though it was painful being lonely, it was nothing like being dumped, but at least it wasn’t constant. . . I sympathize with everyone here, none of you are creeps, I get how it feels to think that you’re going to die alone, and the thought of a gf is laughable. I don’t blame anyone to doing anything (just don’t hurt anyone). People say that we are losers, creep, and fucking scum of there world, but I know better...I know that we are soldiers, holding the fuck on. Those people had it easy, they was born with “courage”, but let me tell you what true bravery is, it is the very thing that dances with hope, it’s is the core of your existence, it’s is the very reason you are here today. You held on, you’ve won every night, alone, by your self. It’s fucking overwhelming, but you held on like a man. Sure, you cried, but isn’t that what makes us human? Isn’t that the very thing that streams through your vain? The very essence that powers, fuses and the very thing that gives you strength? DO YOU NOT REALIZE THAT YOURE A SOLDIER!? You’ve won the battle that killed our brother and sister, the ones who gave into the fear, so won’t you fight for them? Won’t you fight for your future? WONT YOU FIGHT, FOR HER? Because i know she there, even though you don’t. I’ve been though it all, and it is not with sheer luck that I had a gf, it’s is because I held on long enough for me to find her. You never ever know who she is and when she will come. It is no matter if if, it’s is, and I repeat, a matter of WHEN. . . So for those of you who had the heart and soul to read all of this, congratulations, because this is the manual to get a gf. Hold one, be true, and mean while, enjoy life, because you’ll only have it once. Work on your self, for her, do everything in your power to make sure that when she appears, you will be there, wrong as eve you can be. Because one day she will come, oh yes, she fuckkng will, because you’ve won the battle. . . There will be those who are not your final partner, but merely armor that requires you to kill the bosses. They will hurt, oh yes beyond anything you’ve ever felt, but just like always, you will hold on, because you believed. And when you see her, you will know, that all is won.",suicide

"On New Year's Eve I'll either be dead or start a successful career and lifeHey r/suicidewatch,. . &amp;#x200B;. . I am a 18 year old with a giant history of social anxiety. I spent a great part of my youth socially isolated. I would literally not leave my room or interact with anyone except my mum for 6 months, then get taken to a locked psych ward by police for a few months. Therapy never worked a bit for me, so that repeated itself four times, so I spent my entire youth, from 13 to 17 in psych wards.. . &amp;#x200B;. . I never got a degree from a school, because I stopped going 3 months before the final exams, so now I have nothing. My mum kicked me out of the house into my own apartment she paid for. I only got worse and started using drugs. A lot. Eventually got addicted to fentanyl and overdosed alone, it left me a bit brain damaged. My memory is permanently fucked and I have a lazy eye. I have restless legs syndrome now, every night. I'm clean now, though.. . &amp;#x200B;. . Then I discovered benzos, a class of drugs, which are used for anxiety. I ordered them and was able to go outside, be social, manage my life, the relationship with my mum improved, she likes me again and I go out almost every day, but it feels fake. I am on benzos constantly and got addicted, I've been on them for a few months now.. . &amp;#x200B;. . I know that without them, I can't continue the life I currently live. I am utterly scared to live a real life, I couldn't do it, go to work every day, interact with people, I am so scared. The benzos created a path I was never supposed to take. If I stop, I'll fall back into social isolation again, 100%. My mum will hate me again. Everything will be shit again.. . &amp;#x200B;. . I can't continue living a normal, social life, because it scares me so much and I can't stop and go back into isolation until in a few more years I get thrown out because of lack of money or I overdose, because I will end up ordering opioids again, if I go back into social isolation to help me not feel so alone and hopeless. So what am I supposed to do?. . &amp;#x200B;. . Until New Year's Eve, I will make a decision: I either continue using benzos to live a social, normal life, go to school again, be with people, wake up early every day, live a fake life, which would normally scare me into a panic attack or commit suicide. Suicide would stop all this. Everything feels fake, I hate my current position. I feel like I'm going to go with option 2 - suicide, but I am not sure yet. I have everything here for a painless death.... . &amp;#x200B;. . Any thoughts on this? I couldn't write everything that happened down. Everything that hurt me. Everyone that hurt me. The escapes from the psych ward, almost freezing to death in a forest, being handcuffed by police at 6AM, only to be locked away in a psych ward in a white room for months? I have a lot of pain and darkness in me. I am going depressed and psychotic. The benzos make me forget stuff, get timelines completly wrong and make weeks feel like days.",suicide

I’m sick of being scared of flying bugs Like whenever they get close I have this fight or flight feeling and I violently shiver and try to hit it. They make me feel sick and whenever I tell someone I’m just told to man up or deal with it but I can’t. I get erratic and I can’t handle it. There’s nights where there’s a moth in my room and I can not sleep at all because it’s always there and no one ever helps me. I sound like a child and I hate it because I do but I think there’s definitely something wrong with me. I feel embarrassed to ever talk about it even on here too a bunch of strangers but I’m tired of being expected to be not emotional or scared because I’m a boy and “boys aren’t scared of tiny bugs”. I have a panic attack when they circle around me and it’s awful. What can I do? What’s wrong with me?,non-suicide
"My current experienceToday was the first time I called the national suicide prevention hotline, as well as the first time I used their online texting service. Their chatline was very nice, so if that lady sees this 'Natasha', thank you. However afterwards I did call the line and the lady was nice however I'm very socially inept and bad at explaining how I feel verbally as well as starting conversations. So I was a bit upset when the first thing she asked me was if I had abused drugs or alcohol. Later I was transferred to a self harm hotline instead, even though I am suicidal. The man, I'm guessing a volunteer most likely, was a bit rude. When I mentioned a weight problem of mine, keep in mind I'm a 14 year old girl, he asked my weight and height and when I told him he said I had more work to do. Then, when i mention my family problems he got really upset and starting like semi being yelling and just aggressive towards me? Eventually he just straight up hung up on me. I dont know where to else just talk about this, because this was just so- I dont even know. It was an incredibly offputting experience. I feel trapped and alone and dont wanna exist. I dont know how to tell people that I want to kill myself without- freaking myself out. I dont like hearing those words come from me. I dont know how to get help and it's so hard to explain that to people. Whenever my family even gets the idea that I want to, the way they ask just sounds like they're disgusted with me. Like I'm some sick child. I dont know what I'm going to do, I'm not getting better. I'm so bad at explaining how I feel and these people that I'm told are supposed to help just seem like they wanna get rid of me as soon as possible. I dont know how I feel, all I know is that I dont want to exist. Do I have a plan?? Theres so many ways I could do it and ways that it could go wrong. I'm the type of person that thinks of the variables. If I try to get run over on my way to school that person could get in legal trouble because of me. I could mess up. When I call or text for suicide help, it means that's what I need help with. It's so hard to put into words this kind of thing. I dont want to live but to them it feels like it doesnt matter as much if I dont have a strict plan or something. I'm sorry I just I dont know, its frustrating me how it's so hard to get help.",suicide

"It's been a bumpy roadHello everyone!. Well...by posting this, I'm just trying to get something out of my chest and probably, I hope someone relates to this. Also, I might omit details for obvious reasons.. . . It started when I was 7. I got crying spells and had low self esteem. I grew up with my mom, who is single and has depression. My mom was/is loving, always did her best, and was/is never abusive. For some reason, i thought I was a bad child. As for school, I had a lot of bullies (girl bullies are the worst).. . . Fast forward to age 11--&gt; It was the first time I started to think about suicide.  It was after 8th grade, during vacation. I felt a ""need"" to slice my wrists. I've always been the shy kind of person. I never told anyone, since I didn't want my mom to know, and truly, she often talked how she didn't want me to turn out like her. . . . . This thought of suicide accompanied me everyday since that day until I was 21.. It started to get serious in my sophomore year at high school. I had problems with my family besides that. But I just couldn't stop thinking about how could I off myself. . . . In my senior year, I gave myself 5 years more of life (I was 16 when I did this). If it didn't get better in 5 years, I would execute the final plan. The memories of the bullies from school were still tormenting me every night. I didn't decide to do something quick, since my family during all that time, was going through a rough patch, and I didn't want any more people suffering besides me. . Then, college came. I moved away from my family. The first few days were good. Then, I fell into a deep depression for the first 2 years. I kept remembering my 5 year promise. I would cut myself, starve, anything to get a relief. At some point, 3rd year got better. . . By the fourth, it was going ok, but my mom got very sick (did not die, though) and I was far away from her. I had nobody to talk to, and it kept eating me from the inside. Then, I moved again for training before graduation. I met this awesome guy (I'm a girl, btw), but he was kind of a jerk, trying to find himself after being neglected by his parents. I understood that, and we became very good friends until now. During that time, I got sick, and realizing that I was alone was just a spiral down for me. I could not stand living alone anymore. I wanted to take sleeping pills to sleep through the weekends, and I did one time (it was bad). I'm not a drinker, but I started to drink at my place. I got crying spells, I had mood fluctuations, I would get mad for things, and in the past, I would never get mad about little things like I did back then. I couldn't stand myself. I didn't want to talk to anybody. I would hang up on people on the phone. Nothing was interesting, I didn't love anything, food was like cardboard, and I wasn't sure if the person I loved loved me back. I couldn't stand being alone. Goodness...the solitude on that tiny apartment that only had one mattress drove me crazy. And I couldn't go out, because I was paranoid that everyone was looking at me and laughing at me for being alone. Then, I became 21. 5 years had passed. I knew that probably things were not enough to take me to that point, but I honestly couldn't stand myself anymore. One day, a friend invited me to watch a movie. For two times, I almost told my mom, almost told a coworker, and that was the day, and I almost told my friend. I was very scared because it was the first time it had become a real plan with a date and hour. I was going to say ""I need to talk to you"" but before I could say anything, he said in a jokingly way ""GTFO"" and told me that he was kind of late to meet his WOW friends. I said goodbye, and as I was walking to my car, it was sunset. The sun was shinning red, and I felt it as a confirmation that I had to do it that day. I felt some kind of relief, freedom. I went home, and as I was going to execute the plan (I try not to remember it as not to succumb again) my mom called me. She had no clue. I didn't tell her anything. We just talked about the future, about how I was going to get a job and we were going to build a house together and stuff. I don't know why, but that made me stop. Maybe because I realized someone dreamed with me in the future. I know it's hard to step back from this, so don't get offended if this sounds vague.. After that scare, I tried my best (fake? perhaps) to avoid feeling depressed and empty. I even bought a DSi, and games and movies, etc. But I felt it was a forced, fake effort and deep inside, I just couldn't handle it anymore. . . . . . After graduation, i couldn't find a job that allowed me to stay more in the place that I became to love. I moved in with a relative. I think I got better during that time, but I still had the adrenaline rush from the whole situation. I think, by this time, I stopped my thoughts about suicide. I wasn't ready to move to another place, alone, to work. If I had gotten a job, and didn't live with my relative, I would really had killed myself. . . . . . Now, I got a job, but I'm far away from the new people that came to love. Anyways, I had to work hard with myself to accomplish a state  in which, at least, I can be comfortable being alone. A state in which I'm not thinking everyday about dying and that I think i can see light in the future. I'm still very prone to become depressed, but I truly don't want that. I try to avoid it, I keep myself busy. Anything not to go back to that. I wish I had gotten help.  At the same time, I'm glad I didn't. I don't know why.",suicide
"Thoughts on ObsessionThis is a reply I made to a post on this sub which can be found here: [Is anyone else obsessed with suicide?](https://reddit.app.link/2njWamJCA3). I thought maybe it could help some people think about things in another way, maybe it won't help anyone 🤷. I am not an expert on anything besides Guitar Hero, and this is mostly Google-Fu. I encourage everyone to do their own studies on these topics and don't take anything I say as hard fact. I'd urge you to please go and support our friend, who this comment was made for. Good luck everyone!. . I'd say a lot of people on this sub **alone** are obsessed with it, but that doesn't mean you have to bend to it, right? We have a remarkable ability to get **addicted** to pretty much anything and everything in life, anything that fires off any sort of signal of ""pleasure"" in our egg salad **can totally be addictive**.. . They make T.V. shows about it, check out the IMBD description for ""Strange Addictions"": **""Strange"" doesn't seem to adequately describe some of the addictive behaviours profiled on this series. Dangerous, even life-threatening, come much closer. Each half-hour episode features two adults who resort to extreme compulsions in an effort to soothe their emotional demons.**. . Of course things are going to be ""played up"" for T.V., but that doesn't mean theres no truth to the topic. Just a quick Google search will show you how many people struggle with coping in a harmful way, certainly with harmful thoughts.... . **""Almost 21 million Americans have at least one addiction, yet only 10% of them receive treatment. Drug overdose deaths have more than tripled since 1990. From 1999 to 2017, more than 700,000 Americans died from overdosing on a drug. Alcohol and drug addiction cost the U.S. economy over $600 billion every year.""**. . ...and that's just **my** country. Yes it's referring to **drug addiction** and not **suicidal ideation** addiction, but I'd wager that **many** if not **most** people suffering from long-term depression, probably go through their share of suicidal thoughts, would you agree?. . **""According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), across the United States, 8.1 percent of people over the age of 20 have depression over any given 2-week period. For some people, depression might only be episodic and overcome within a matter of weeks or months.""**. . 2 weeks doesn't seem like much, but that's over **any two week period** as in, **at all times**, and these are just what's **reported**. 8.1% of the 330 million people in America, would come out to something like 26.7 **million** people, **at any given time**, who are struggling with depression **enough** that they sought help for it.. . But for a tobacco smoker to ""quit smoking"", to **free herself from addiction**, she has to go through her days, for months, **constantly bombarded** by her addiction trying to retake control. Pretty much every moment of the day for a couple weeks at least, her mind is constantly making her [feel like shit](https://youtu.be/whbhunRApSU) for not **doing the thing** it has grown accustomed to over the years.. . I would argue the same is true for your suicidal ideation, you have to **actively fight** not the urge to use a drug, but the urge to think of suicide in a positive light. This is from Tha Wikipedia: **Most people who have suicidal thoughts do not go on to make suicide attempts, but suicidal thoughts are considered a risk factor.**. . To stop **obsessing** over something that your mind has grown accustomed to, you have to actively fight the urge to equate it to positive feelings: ""It would be great if I were dead"" &lt; ""It would **not be so great** if I were dead, look at all the bad stuff that would happen!"". . I would also argue that you are definitely not **wasting your parents money**. That money they're spending is likely the greatest investment of their lives to them, don't believe me though: ask them! We can spend money on all sorts of trivial things in life, but the well being of a **human person** that we **care about** is a greater use of our green than any other.. . If you'd like to, I'd love to hear back from you and continue the discussion. You are as important and worthwhile as anyone else and I know **you believe that** somewhere **in the mind**. Please don't hurt yourself, and good luck friends!",suicide

"Killing myself after I post thisHey everyone. I made a throwaway so if I do survive I don’t have to live with the shame of seeing this in my post history. I had no one to say goodbye to so I’m saying goodbye to a bunch of strangers. Like a weirdo.. I’m 16, and I know people might think I still have time to turn my life around, I’ve heard it all by now. Therapy, pills, friends, psych wards, whatever the fuck you name, I’ve tried it. It’s all bullshit. Life is bullshit. I have been abused at home since I was 3 years old by an alcoholic mother, who is now using my little brother as a second chance at “raising someone who isn’t a worthless eyesore”. I can’t bear to look at her putting all her hope of raising someone who’s not gonna waste away in a filthy room for weeks while not speaking and staring at a wall into such a young child. People think it’s jealousy, it’s not. I know she’s going to crush all his hopes and dreams when he grows up, and I can’t bear to wait to see it happen like it did to me.. I used to have dreams once. I wanted to be an artist. Cliche as fuck, but it was my dream and I was set on it. Everyone hadn’t my back except for the one person who I needed the most. She pushed me aside for cocaine and vodka. She burned all my art when I was 8 and beat me until I said I wanted to be a lawyer or doctor, forgot which one. I had 5 broken ribs and she had dislocated most of my right half in the process of throwing me around like a rag doll ( I still have issues with joints dislocating to this day). My nose broke and she almost blinded me with glass from a bottle, so yeah, that dream was crushed. At age 9, I was made to cook and clean for myself. She didn’t lift a finger to help me while I scalded my whole lower half with a pot of boiling water, instead laughing at me and blaming me in the ER after the neighbors called the police due to my screaming and crying. I still have scars from that which I get bullied for. I never had a single friend in school, I was the quiet, poor kid who always smelled weird and cried all day. . At age 12, I fell in with the wrong crowd and I’m still addicted to cigarettes, which is tame compared to other shit I did back then. I was raped by 6 people in the space of an hour, and since then I have not had a period (no I’m not pregnant). I gave up on school and I just sit there blankly all day or just don’t show up, for which my mother beats me, and even my therapist gave up on me and cancels every appointment we have last minute.. Now I’m sitting on my bed after taking around 6 bottles of sleeping pills (I stocked up, yay), waiting for them to kick in and typing this. No one is going to miss me. Not a single person. I didn’t leave a note. There’s no point since my mother will throw it away when she finds me. Hopefully hell doesn’t exist since I’m definitely gonna end up there if it does. . I had a good run.

I’m kinda failing my own expectations and know that I’m not operating at the level needed to accomplish my ambitions (Lawyer or Firm Owner). I have dreams of success and I want nothing more than to shatter my expectations and help make the world a better place, which I need money to do. I also love cars and traveling, two things that require money. Plus law is something I find incredibly interesting. Right now I just feel disillusioned with my own effort and wish I was doing more.. . The biggest things keeping me going right now are my girlfriend, friends, and family.

"Rough time lately, really need a friendThings have been so bad lately. I have already gotten through some really bad things. But just this past month has been thing after thing and I've been trying to handle it. My cat had to get surgery and then today I had to rush him back to the vet because one of his sutures came out, and everything has just been really dramatic and difficult lately, and I don't have anyone. I just don't have any support, and I can't take it anymore. I have this ""boyfriend"" in Alaska but he's gone a lot, he's usually not even available due to being in the middle of nowhere or something and he's supposed to come back Christmas and I'm supposed to show I'm strong without him but I literally want to die because I have no one else and I can't do this. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I've reached out to friends and people know I'm having a hard time and they just don't care. I really just don't have any friends at all and I can't take it anymore and it makes me feel like I don't even matter and if I can't get my shit together then I can't even be with this guy and I don't feel like I have anything to live for and it's a problem and people hate me for that but I don't know how to find something to live for or get through all this shit and then live for anything and I need help but no one helps and it's always been this way and yes I help myself, I've been going to therapy for 6 years. I do all the work I'm supposed to do. What is so wrong with me? What is so repulsive about me? Is it these problems because that's not fair, it's just not fair I can't just shake them away. I've even tried to do that but I am so lonely, there is just no one and I feel so pathetic and I never used to drink but I'm drinking now because I just can't handle these things, it's too many things and no one is listening to me, no one cares. And I'm tired, tired of trying and I just need someone to talk to and there's literally no one to talk to. I've even reached out to old friends. No one fucking cares about me. I just don't understand what I'm supposed to do. ",suicide

"I really really want to end it all somehowHello. My name is Benji, I’m 15 turning 16 in a month or so. I have this incredible urge to end it all, I’ve just been super uninterested in my passions lately, and kinda depressed. The main thing is, I suffer from severe anxiety, I can’t stop getting the feeling that my boyfriend doesn’t love me like I love him. I try to make sure that he does and I constantly say how much I appreciate him but when I say it too much it annoys him. He assures me that my paranoias are untrue but I Just really feel inside that he wishes he weren’t with me. We been dating on and off since mid last year, and only for the past month we’ve officially been together but I love him so so so much, probably because we’ve known eachother for much longer. I don’t know what to do. It just feels so satisfying to somehow choke myself. As I type this out, maybe it’s not such a good idea. But idk what to do. Another factor is that I’m very vocally anti racist on Twitter, this is a stance that I love having and I still feel the need to post against the oppression of black people but on this side of Twitter, so much I hear “Mayo monkeys” “I hate all white people” and even though it is supposedly a joke it really hurts me and makes me want to end it all. Please read all this, idk what I’m even posting this here for, idk what I’m hoping to get. I desperately hope nobody in my real life finds out I’m feeling this way.",suicide

"I need some advice/help I know this might not seem like the biggest deal to some people but i just want some advice . . So about a month ago a girl i liked asked me out and i said yes. (I am a guy btw 16) I really like her and she is really pretty. Throughout the time we have been dating, I am trying my hardest to be the best boyfriend that i can be. Just always asking her how she is doing and trying to talk to her. . . Thats the problem tho. Trying. Every time i try and talk to her she just seems like she doesn’t care and only gives me like 2 word responses. I try to keep the conversation going but its so exhausting. But in the meantime when we are school she talks to literally every other guy in our friend group. Like openly and right in front of me. Only saying hi when i first see her. Also for a little bit i was in a group chat with all those people and she constantly talked on their but hasn’t opened any of my chats at all. Plus i think she has texted me first one or twice. . . I am just getting the impression that I’m just a status to her. Like i am her boyfriend, thats it. And not someone who she actually want to hang around or talk to. Like if i were to place me and all the other guys on a tier list or something, i would be at b tier at best. Its just so frustrating. Its so one sided that talking to her is more of a chore then something i like doing. . . She also doesn’t seem to want to do anything either. Like we had our first date like a week after she told me she likes me and we haven’t done anything else. . . I want to talk to her about it but i dont know how and feel like she wouldn’t even try to change something.. . I am just so confused and tired of this and i dont know what to do. . .

"Im scared and i don't know what to do.I have to start from the beginning. TLDR at the end. bad grammar and spelling because idgaf.. . Ever sense i was a kid I've kind of fantasized about dying. not necessarily suicide just fantasizing about a bullet coming from no where or a bomb dropping on where i am. I never thought much of it. My life was great by most peoples standards and i knew that. Never thought I'd actually do it just thought it was a harmless little quirk so I ignored it and thought of it as day dreaming. Then i started to get older. Highschool came and all the emotional battles with it. Every once in a while the ""fantasy"" would be a little more serious, extreme in moments of sadness. But to be honest i never thought id have the balls to do it and i still acknoledged that my life is still pretty great by most peoples standards (good parents, good brother, OK friends). I never had an actual reason to hate my life so they kept being fantasies. Then adult hood came. Things just got worse, legitimate depression. But i overcame, through the help of a GREAT friend i was able to escape the things bothering me and live with him while i studied to try and get a ""real"" job. I got that job and everything was great, for a while. They started being just fantasies again just bullets and bombs and bullshit. Then i moved out started paying my bills and was really proud of my self. Honestly never thought id amount to anything. Honestly i didn't, just got lucky enough to have that friend. I had a phase where things got really bad, sitting with a gun in my lap crying for hours. I honestly couldn't tell you why i thought my life was so bad, a girl was involved one i thought i loved sense high school, hence the username. I turned to cutting my thighs, because it honestly did make me feel better and stop thinking about suicide. Plus people couldn't see my thighs because i always wore pants, almost always. Plus all my shorts were long enough to cover it up. This went on for a few months. I came out to a close friend whod experienced cutting. They told me i needed to stop keeping it a secret and talk to the people who care about me. I did. and i stopped.But the fantasies continued. I managed to kind of robot my self through the past couple of years sense then. Getting bad fantasies and depression sometimes but always trying to go just hang out with someone before i started getting really bad.Then one of my best friends, a great fucking person, died from a relapse, seized in front of a fire station. He was comatose for something like 2-3 weeks. I came and saw him every day. I watched him die. We begged and pleaded for him to hold on. Screaming beating his chest. I watched him hold on until his brother told him it was ok to go. and then he just stopped breathing. That was late December of last year. Things have been a bit off in my head after that.And that brings me to now in my life. That ""real""job i was talking about. Well i thought i could actually obtain happiness and not just content mediocrity by trying to advance my career. Plus i thought it would help me get out of the deep depression i was falling in after birdarms(friend) death. I got a pretty good job by my standards working in a GE factory ( always wanted to be an engineer so this was awesome) making 18 an hour which is ALOT for me. They threw me to the fucking wolves. 1 day of training, fucking one. My only coworker, a half-assed week of training. We were fucking lost but both pretty good at what we do so we managed. I was a week away from tenure and i wont go into to much detail but i fucked up the wrong guy and caused a lot of loss of production literally RIGHT after a merger. Despite the fact that, according to policy the employee was the one at fault, I was the one that got canned cause he was TOP dick and im just a peon. Welp i was still a week away from fufilling my 3 month contract to hire so they canned me. I REALLY wanted that job. When i got it i thought "" im pretty good at my job this isnt a risk"" and took out a loan for an apartment and a car ( mine was broken down beyond repair, i fucked up trying to fix it and got the timing off. ). So now here i am, 2 weeks late on rent for the second time, not really any hope of getting a job anytime soon. and to top it off i got three 100+ tickets for taillight, failure to present insurance card, speeding, and failure to show regestration (dont know why i didnt have four). That was a week before they canned me. My license is probably suspended right now. Making getting another job in my feild even harder. Most all of the interviews ive had have turned up nothing. Im hungry and depressed. The fantasies are starting to get really strong. They arnt really fantasies anymore. Stopped being fantasies a long time ago. Im scared because i feel like all it would take at this point for me to act on that impulse would be an eviction notice on my door. I live in a BAD neighborhood and keep a gun by my door. Does not help with the thoughts. I dont know what to do because, one, my self and my parents dont have the money for me to admit myself and two, what good would it do, i would honestly come out in a worst position then im in now. More debt, worse credit, and probably no car. I feel and ALWAYS have felt that im a little bitch for thinking like this. There are so many people out there in worse situations than mine. I know because im always there to do whatever i can if my friends are stuggling, and sometimes they do, in my opinion worse then i do. Which is why i havent been telling them any of this this time around. I honestly feel it would be selfish for me to off myself. Call me full of my self but i honestly feel like if i did there might be someone i care about following close behind. But thats not why im not doing it. Im not doing it because i feel like im a little bitch and i dont deserve the right to kill myself for the stupid little problems im dealing with. I dont know if theres really anything i can do other than cross my fingers and hope i find a job before im kicked out on the street. I honestly think im crazy. These fantasies have evolved into hour long pointless crying fits. Crying and depression for literally i have no fucking clue. i Honestly feel like i make up an excuse to be sad so i dont feel like im crazy when that shit happens. I have never told anyone this. I am very close to alot of people and have a hard time keeping my mouth shut. But i have never told anyone the full story. Where better than reddit. Hence the user name.. . . TLDR: Ive fantasized about death sense i was a kid. That turned into fantasizing while sad, which turned into actual depression, which led to actual suicidal thoughts. and now the point in my life now makes me scared that ill act on the impulse but i feel like there is really jack shit i can do about it. Except get lucky. plus im a pussy.",suicide

"I Hate EveryoneIm interested in politics, science, and I want to get into philosophy. No-one else in my school is interested in those things. All of my conversations are trivial, and have nothing to do with anything I like. I believe this is one of the main causes of my suffering. I feel like no-one else values what I have to say becuase it is either “boring” or “too serious.” And the. They start talking about shitty memes. I wish I could just fucking punch them in their stupid fucking faces. But, it would be out of jealousy of their happiness, and their ignorance to how shitty their life will become. . . Another cause of my suffering is my thinking about the future. The skills I harbor are not valued in the job market. I already know I will be poor, and my parents will make fun of me, and call me “libtard.” They are brainwashed by Brintbart, and believe anything on Fox News, especially my father. I want to read Nietzsche for Christmas, but I doubt my parents will buy the book, becuase it makes arguments the portray Christianity negatively. My parents keep telling me I’m smart because I taught myself some Math, but they can’t trust me to read something that portrays Christianity negatively. Fucking hate these stupid brainwashed fucks. . . Finally, I can’t have a Cat. This is mostly out of my control, since my mother is allergic, but it makes me really sad. My friend has a cat and I spent hours petting it and loving it. It made me happier, but No. I can’t have that. Fuck you “benevolent” God! . . I think I’m going to start cutting myself. Fuck this.

"Can people please stop being so dumb about Americans and Imperial Measurements? Like the amount of ignorace non-Americans have about Americans using the system is just annoying. Like seriously people, Americans, firsr, DO USE THE METRIC SYSTEM. We all learn it in school and for things like science class and whatnot. And then, it is almost exclusively used in certain fields, like science, etc, where the precision is needed. So pleasr, can we stop using ""It's bad for science"" as an offense against it, we already know and don't care. The system is made for everyday simple use, that's why it has things like a base-12 system that can be devided much more than a base-10, and why we have odd stuff like yards. Most measurements are made to fit a specific need and do so pretty well (think Inch small, Foot medium, Yard large, and mile for massive distance). And yes, we know these measurements seem kinda dumb, but we are USED to them and just understand them well after being around them our whole lives. People outside the US find them much worse because they haven't used them their entire lives.

"This year may be my breaking pointPlease read, I know it's long but please.. . I'm 16. Around a year ago, the love of my life(18) left. We could hardly see each other and it was hard on the both of us. It all but killed me. It almost did a few times... I wish I had successfully finished the job. I'm such a failure I couldn't even od right. The break up might have been the worst thing to me, but it was only the beginning of the longest, most painful year of my life. A few weeks later, my sister and I were forced into a New Year's 5 day ""vacation"" with my mom, little step brother(6), and my mother's husband (step douche or SD). SD has always hated me, he's cussed me out, hit me, screamed at me, threatened me, etc. It went mostly well... Until the last day. My little brother wanted to go on the small ice skating rink. Thing is, I have really, really bad anxiety. This actually keeps me from normal daily activities, and from doing things I enjoy/want to do. There was SO MANY PEOPLE, so skating wasn't an option for me. SD got pissed, yelled at me and called me ungrateful and disrespectful and selfish and told us we were staying yet another day (he knew that would set me off, I hate being around them) and i lost it. I told him, ""f*ck no we aren't I'm sorry for my language but I can't do this anymore."" And walked away. We soon left, the ride to the hotel was silent. We got there, me and my sister started packing. Here comes the hell. SD starts screaming again telling me and my sister to get the **** out of his ******* hotel room, blah blah, and he starts coming up the stairs. I run to the bathroom connected to my sister's bedroom and lock the door while she locks the bedroom door... God knows what would've happened if we didn't. He beats on the door, screaming and threatening us, saying very violent things. He's still beating on the door, kicking it, screaming, then calls the cops to come remove us for trespassing. My mom secretly called them back and quickly explained the situation. My little 6 yr old brother was crying telling us to please come out of the room so his dad would stop yelling. This absolutely broke me to hear. I didn't open the door. The police came, were super nice, helped us out and carried mine and my sisters stuff, and took us to the head office of the hotel about 2 minutes away. We waited 4 hours for my dad to drive there and pick us up. A few months later, I was put on a new medication (anxiety and depression stuff) and it ended up making me have 4 seizures. One at home alone after school, one at school (the only one they took me to the hospital for), another at home alone (thankfully on my bed this time, still broke stuff on my side table, busted my lip, bit my tongue HARD, and had a know on my head), then the last one while I was asleep. I'm failing my classes, I failed my driving test (I got it the 2nd time tho so I have my license now!), everyday is full of yelling, I have to give my Axolotl away cause I can't take care of him properly, my friend tried to overdose... Me and my ex still talk sometimes. Very rarely though. We were supposed to get back together when I turned 16. He'd be able to drive then, have his own place. When he told me there was hope for us I had reason to live again. I felt happiness again. But his mom was hospitalized and he got evicted. He had to move even farther away. We didn't get back together because of this. He told me he still wishes there could be something between us again, but because of the distance, there can't be. . . I don't want to be here for so many reasons. There isn't a day that does by that I don't think about him or daydream what could be. I have dreams about him.

The only thing holding me back is my parents, since they've invested so much into me, and me killing myself would cement how much of a failure I actually am in their minds. Even that though, is waning, since I'm going to have to show them my grades eventually, and then they'll know how shitty I am regardless. . . Today was particularly bad for no reason.

"I'm not fit for this worldFor the past two or three years I've been suicidal. I'm on drugs which i keep fooling myself into thinking they work but in reality I still think about how easy it would be to just let go. How the world wouldn't be impacted at all. Because I know deep down that im not fit for this world, I'm not strong enough to continue, let alone succeed. I went in for an application today and I probably won't fill it out because I cant socially function well enough to get through a job interview. I've been scraping at the bottom of the barrel grades-wise for the past 4 years, only passing because the only thing I'm good at is taking tests. And even that hurts me, because that just gives my parents too high of an expectation. ""Why did you fail this marking period, you're a genius"" ""I know you can do better maybe if you weren't so lazy"". I've heard it all too many times, and frankly i can't take it anymore. I can't live up to the ""genius"" expectations I somehow got put into. I can't just do what everyone else can. ""You're not exempt from homework, you're not special, you're just like everyone else, you don't get special treatment"". This is what puts me over the edge, I've never asked for special treatment nor will I. I just know that I'm not going to make something of myself, I just can't, I'll admit I'm a cesspool of potential but i just can't push myself to succeed. I do ok, just ok. ""adequate"" even. But even I know that all the special innovations that can be made are already being made by scientists around the world and I'm not in a position to be able to just fail high school and invent something amazing. I just know i can't. So whats the point? As of now I'm seen as a good person, someone who's decent, and might be able to do well, and be successful. But that all disappears once i start failing. Because I know it will..... Eventually. And in that moment alone I will be seen in the lowest regard I ever have been. I'll be shut out from society, not helped, all because ""I can do it I'm just being lazy"", and that's all it boils down to. I'm just seen as someone who can do it  just too lazy. Well I can't, i can't just magically turn myself around, there is no drug, nothing that can just magically make me put effort into things that matter most. So why continue and ruin what I am already? Because as of right now I'm missed by coaches i quit on because they saw potential in me. I'm seen as a great student by some teachers, and the others still see me in a high regard. But over time I'll be seen as a lost cause, someone who can't be saved. And if there is anything i don't want to be, is forgotten, this note isn't going to be seen by any of my peers because I don't know how they will react to seeing a different side of me. It wont be seen by my parents because they'll admit me to a fucking mental institution, again. And neither of those options help my situation, so I'll leave it to the non judgmental things that I know of, my therapist and reddit. Now I know that may be seen as ridiculous but I feel like if i get input from people all around the world who may be struggling or struggled with the situation I'm in, I'll make it through just one more day. Because in the morning after a long nights sleep I'll forget this, but these feelings don't go away forever. It happens out of nowhere, an ex accidentally sends you a text, you realize that you haven't been in an actual relationship in months, and the person you've been talking to for those months you can't even call your girlfriend. But you keep trying and can't move on because she is all you have left. The only friend who would've understood what you're writing you pushed away. And all the others would just socially avoid me in fear they would do something to make me kill myself. And i can't live like that, not now, not when my family is struggling the most they ever have. And I can't weigh them down. It's selfish to make them have to be worried about me contently and not be able to focus on whats important because all I am is a lost cause, just waiting to be forgotten.",suicide

I'm still really angry all the time and I'm still suicidal, but since I started the medication I'm absolutely terrified of dying. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing - right now it keeps me from attempting suicide but I can't really be sure in the long run. . . I've also developed stomach problems that so far haven't been diagnosed. I've seen a gastroenterologist and about 3 other doctors for a while now and nothing. My stomach hurts all the time regardless of what I eat. I've tried everything in the book and multiple medications. It just seems crazy that this problem could be going on for so long. . . I just don't know what to do. I really don't have anyone I can talk to about this. My parents have already told me that they don't approve of me being on anxiety medication and they've already told me how they think anxiety disorders are bullshit. My husband has only been angry with me recently because I've been isolating myself from everyone. I only have one friend who I haven't spoken to in nearly a month. I don't really know who to turn to I guess. . . Thanks for listening to me rant. If anyone can talk with me that would be great. ",suicide

"A New LowI feel really weak. Growing up, my future was flooded with the ideas I'd magically turn into a handsome, smart, extrovert, who had no problem with life, and lived for the next day. Now, I can't wait till I can get to bed and shut it all off. I am close to being 25 and I am no where close to being the type of guy I imagined myself becoming. I have a true love and compassion for all people, yet all the love and compassion I have, has led me to feeling like this. I have recently found out I have herpes (cold sores) and can only assume I've given it to other people. I hate myself so much. I don't do a damn thing to contribute, and all I care about is impressing friends I see often. I'm at a major road block in my life, and I'd rather sit and look at it, rather than make a choice. All I ever do is think about traveling, or getting away from everyone I know, and just starting over. All I ever do, is try to escape current feelings. I just want to be a good person, but feel completely diminished to the point where I don't think I can be anything. I want death. I could go into how much I hate the way our society conducts itself, but it feels like I'm just doing it so to make me feel better. I just want to be a human being, I don't want to be defined by my job. I want to love, and be loved, but feel like such a leper. I hate looking at my face everyday, seeing a cold sore. I hate that the only thing a person can say, is it's a part of growing up or make better choices. I wish we as human beings could turn our efforts to helping people, and not turn people against each other. Sometimes I feel like people can see how bad I want to leave this Earth,  and in turn feel bad about themselves, because they probably think their the reason I want to die. I thought about my dad dying about an hour ago (he's still alive) and I was even more crushed, because I don't think I'm strong enough for it in any sort of way. Especially going down the road I am, I will have showed him how all his efforts and life have led me to consistent drinking and smoking weed daily. It hurts me as well, how much resentment I have towards my mother. Not that she's been that bad of a mom, but I really just don't like the person she is. Whats worse is how similar her and I are. I'm a mommy's boy that does similar things to her. I hate all the times, I talk with close friends, and people I admire, and they catch themselves about to say something that would be demeaning to me. Because I'm 24, live at home, barely go to school, have cold sores and strongly suspect I have them too(I've never told them I have them, because ""they would never be cool with someone who had them"") I wish I never impacted anyones life. I have truly felt the reality, of ""growing up"" and all I want to do is stop growing.",suicide

"I tried and failed, but gunna try again.Hi all, I recently tried to kill myself by hanging.  I posted this earlier on r/AMA but i got a lot of negative feedback, hopefully the people here are a touch more compassionate.  By a complete fluke, my neighbour walked in about 30 seconds after id stepped off my stool to return a popcorn bowl.  Id been planning this for about a year, and i think im going to give it another go at the end of the month, and make sure my door's locked this time.  . . . I'm not irrational, i dont try and kill myself out of some emotional outburst, and its not a spur of the moment decision.  My life is actually quite good, I've got a good job as a concept artist, i own my own condo, I've got lots of good friends.. . I was quite badly neglected as a child.  My therapist told me i have a form of low grade background depression; its just always there, like an itch you can't scratch.  It feels like being stuck at an airport with nowhere to go, just always in transit, never quite at home.    . . . Ive never had much luck in relationships.  Im quite handsome, im fun to be around.  Im compassionate and I invest in the people im close to, yet it seems the women i meet are more interested in using me to boost their self esteem and move on after 2 weeks.  I dont know how many times ive gotten something along the lines of ""youve given me the self confidance i need to move on and find what im really looking for."". . I've accepted that life can be brutal and unfair, that people can be unbelieveably selfish, and you have to be a boarderline sociopath to make it in this world.  Its just that, im not built that way, so there's really not a place for me here.  So i'm leaving.  . . .

"Its so quietI have been suicidal for years, around maybe six. In that time, I've been physically abused for two, mentally abused for one and been admitted into the hospital for an OD suicide attempt, along with many other unknown attempts. I've visited two different therapists, attended a group on abuse and taken many colorful antidepressants. None of them helped. None. . . My divorced parents couldn't give a fuck less. In fact, when I was admitted into the hospital, they never visited me. They saw the cutting marks on my arms too but never said anything. They just told me that I was crazy and wanted nothing to do with me. I had friends throughout life, all of my depression would vanish around them. But they soon disappeared, not believing me when I said I was in an abusive relationship. They are now friends with my abusive exes over me. . . The only hope I had left has disappeared now. He was my boyfriend and he was perfect and understanding. But he's since ignored me and I'm finally taking the hint, its been two weeks since I've heard from him. In a sickening funny way, he already had a girlfriend commit suicide over him. I understand what she was thinking now, as he is a wicked soul who knows exactly what women want to hear. He disgusts me. Also, he was there and visited me in the hospital when I ODed. Yet, he agrees to a relationship he clearly didn't mean. I don't understand. . . I have no one to talk me down or cheer me up. My parents would be happy if I wasn't such a burden on them. I don't have any friends that would care to listen to my whining. And most of all, I couldn't talk to the only person who is making me feel this way. He won't pick up no matter what I say. . . All I want is to finally end it all. To know peace. To let everyone live their lives as they want. Without me. Everyone fucking hates me and I need help. I'm going crazy all alone. I don't know how I'm going to do it yet. I'd gladly OD but the only connection I know is my ex bf's best friend, and he controls him. I don't own a gun and I'm afraid a car crash won't suffice. So ideas would be welcomed, largely.",suicide

"I'm at the end of my rope.Hey, uhh, never really done this but i'm just going start by saying Thank you for taking the time to read this. I am also do not think i would kill myself, but I do fear that i am becoming to reckless. Basically, I feel emotionally Drained at the moment, and I stumbled across this sub-reddit awhile ago and thought maybe someone would like to talk, or just listen.. . I am current 18 years old and a male, I grew up in the worse part of Canada. Suicide, death and disappointment was always a big role in my life. I was also unfortune enough to be born with a rare case of speech aperixa and Autism. My family life was great, but the neighourbour hood was ridiculously horrid. I was bullied all my life and still am bullied. This leading me to have horrible self confidence. My first experience with death was very little, most of my uncles died due to lung cancer from smoking to much, or suicide. I also did not have any money Growing up, my mother and father worked 2 jobs each and left me and my siblings home alone a lot. thankfully me and my brother stayed close but my sister got into drugs and gangs and what not. she suffers from bi polar and takes it out on me and my older brother (shes the oldest.) Blah i dont know where im going with this but all im trying to get across is that i had a rough time growing up. Death, bulling and Poverty.. . Ive suffered from depression pretty much my whole life. I met a girl when i was in 14 that saved me from this. i love her a lot and She means the world to me. when i was 17 I stood by my grandmothers side as her kidneys failed and She was there by my side the whole time. I didnt cry when my grandmother passed, im a logical thinker so i knew it was coming, i accepted it and moved on with the support her. I also took my basic parachutist course (im a paratrooper) at only 17! which is my proudest Life accomplishment, but i couldn't do it with out her. She lifted my spirit, and thats a big reason why i am here.. . Anyways, i feel like im at the end of my rope lately because this last month was fucking horrific. everything that could go wrong is going wrong. It all started with one of my closest friend killing herself, it sucked i knew her since i was like 12. that was a rough fault, but she supported me. that same week my best friend killed himself. i knew him since i was 5. once again i stayed strong and showed no weakness. i had great support with family and her.. . After i grieved for awhile, i continued life. until my uncle killed my auntie then himself. this was rough i was really close with them and it shocked me that he could do that. but like i said im a logical and mythological thinker so i dealt with it the best way i could and she was always there to lean on. a week after that incident my Great uncle, whom i visited monthly died of old age. Sadly i could not be there on his death bed due to university and he lived 3 hours away. i attended his funeral and once again she was there to lean on. just like she always was and always will be... so i thought.. . a few weeks ago she dumped me. Saying she needed to Find herself. i have never felt more lost, more confused more disappointed in my entire life. Like i said i like to believe im a logical thinker, but this, i cant Seem to find a point where my mind is the winner. my heart is in pieces and every time i try to come to an honest conclusion my body aches and i just weep. I just dont know what to do. I love her and always will, and although everyone says that ill find someone else i feel like i wont. And as stupid as that sounds, i know it sounds stupid i hear myself and i think to myself that im an dumb ass for thinking that, its the only conclusion i can see at the moment. my heart is so dedicated and so loyal that the thought of anyone else is redonkulous.. . I feel discarded, i feel old and boring. Like a simple phase made my life lose meaning. i was there for her, and she was there for me and now all of a sudden im alone again. My friend are all drug addicted or bad influences and i dont want to go down that road. i am the only friend i have with a grade 12 and the only one who is in university. i have horrible social skills and i feel like i cant find anyone who can know me aswell as she did. i told her everything and she told me everything i feel like i lost a part of me.. . i feel like i need help but i dont know where to go. Ive cried to my mother enough and i dont want to be a burden, ive tried to talk to my friends but they just dont get it? we were talking me and her, but all of a sudden we just stopped, the biggest part my life is suddenly a stranger yenno? its a weird and emotional time for me with everyone dying and i have no one to fall back on. I have nobody, so i came to you guys. i hope someone has had a similar experience or something close, and i realize that not all situations are the same but i just need to vent i guess.. . Regardless, im starting to drink a lot. starting to stay out late (used to be home at like 11, because Fuck to police) ahah no, i used to be home early out of respect for my mother and father. i like to think im a respectful young adult, but my lifes going to shit. im barely going to university and im scared im going to fail. Actually... im just scared. the unknown is now the only thing i have left. i used to hit the gym regually but not even that seems boring and everything i do is just a memory of her. it just nothing makes sense and i need a helping hand but i dont know where to start.. . honestly the only thing i have currently is my music, and my fave artist is Taylor swift which doesnt help because all she fucking sings about is her exs. what the fuck is wrong with me reddit? Urggh. i dont know im just ranting now i apologize. Regardless can you guys help me out?. . P.s i realize how ridiculous this is, i tottaly jumped all over the place, i just have a lot on my mind currently and i havent talked to anyone about all this. please forgive me and i thank you sincerely if you read my whole post. it means a lot just to know that someone listened, while... Read, what i was feeling. thank you. also i dont know you, but just know that i love all of you guys. a lot. thank you, ill try to stay up to read any replies i may get, but because its kinda late i doubt anyone will see this.. . fuck. thank you.",suicide

"Friend needs helpI am writing for a friend who lives in the US. We just met online playing games and got to know each other.. . I think his financial difficulties plus having no friends to hang out with irl is making him depressed. Once he said, ""it's hard to have a gf when you're broke and have no car, etc"". He isn't a bum or bad looking but he self\-deprecate. It's hard to meet people once you're out of school and it doesn't help having an introvert personality. In the past, he mentioned he did some psychedelic drugs and cut himself. Now he just drink/smoke and complain about feeling stuck and being lonely. Recently, he told me he put a gun in his mouth and almost did it. Before this, he was awake for 48 hours and drinking. I asked him if he can get rid of the gun and try to get some sleep after work but I didn't get any response yet.. . I guess I just want to ask if you have any other ideas what I can do for him other than just talk? He doesn't listen to me and I don't want to act like nothing happened. I think he is too stubborn to get professional help but I can ask him to try. It is much better for him to have someone to talk to in person. Where to start, who to call? Suicide prevention hotline, support groups?. . I made this account just for this purpose and I'm new to Reddit. Thank you for your time and help! ",suicide

"my dad doesnt give two craps about me. im constantly depressed, tired, bored, lonely and sad.. i cry for no reason and i just dont know what do do anymore.. please helpEdit so, ive always had an okay life. not great, but do able. when i was young my dad was my hero. then at the age of 3, my parents divorced, and i got to see my dad like 2 or three times a year. i have 2 older sisters. my moms boyfriend was extremely abusive to all of us, and we grew scarred. not physically, but emotionally. he would scream and yell and call all of us names. he left us so many times and came back and now im living with him again. he got his problems sorted out and hes nice now. so my dad... he beat up my oldest sister because she was drunk and they havent talked for about 11 years/ shes 25 now. my dad said he didnt consider her his daughter anymore. so my second older sister, shes 21 now and my dad never tries to contact her. my dad has a new wife who would always complain about how we made a mess (like leaving a wrapper or two on the table or something) and how we ate all of their food. she always makes my dad tell him to tell us stuff SHE doesnt like because she doesnt want to be the bad guy. they have 3 kids together. and ever since i could remember, my dads always said he would take me and my sister to meico for a vacation. he never has. but has gone soo many fukcing times behind OUR backs with ALL OF HIS NEW KIDS. and lies to us and never tells us cause he knows its wrong of him. its so upsetting. i once asked for 40 dollars once and he said no, claiming that it would be a waste because ' all my animals die anyways.' (because i wanted a pet lizard.). . and he once got my sister a bag of used clothes for christmas. and buys us the crappiest stuff like a blanket, some candy, ugly clothes.. and i think its because he lets his wife do everything. shes a control freak and always yells at him and tells him what to do. its like he has no brain for himself. meanwhile he enrolls his new kids in hockey, swim lessons, karate lessons and gets them whatever the hell they want. it was in the court papers that i had to go visit for summer, cristmas and march break and only i could say no to visiting. i never did. untill recently. (please keep reading i have a lot more to write as i havent even asked the question yet). . ive always seen my dad as the best guy in the world. hes funny, and he makes me laugh and feel good. being around him is just great.. i feel warm when hes there.. i havent seen him since i started thinking this. about a year ago, i started to really think about why my sisters had strange feelings about him. i started to learn more and more about him and it lifted that nice sunshine i placed over him for so long because i just wanted to believe that he really loved me and cared for me.. . since i turned 16, he sent me some flowers, (or most likely, his wife because i also found out it wasnt even him writing me my birthday cards and every other card i got from them...) it said that since i was 16 i would be able to book when i would be able to come to visit. which basically meant: i dont care if i see you so im not going to bother unless YOU ask ME to come visit. that was in february. i was supposed to see him for march break, but he never contacted me about it so i did. at first,. . he didnt answer but then at the very last second, he said i wouldnt be able to come visit because he said he wouldnt be able to do anything with me because his arthritis was getting bad. then he tried to soften the blow by saying id have more fun being with my boyfriend instead. i mean, i hadnt seen him in such a long time i didnt even care if we didnt do aything special. i think it was just a lie. so i said i would be coming for easter and he agreed.. . easter came around and i decided to stay home because i didnt really feel welcome anymore.. and i had family visiting so i called and left him a message saying i wouldnt be coming, but lied about why. in the message i said okay so call me back when you get this message. since then he hasnt bothered to contact me in any ways. even though i made him promise me he would contact me more often... he broke his promise.. so im just waiting and waiting for him to call me.... . ive been feeling so sick inside for the last like, 8 months and its getting worse and worse each day. i hide my feelings and stuff them deep inside because i just want to forget.. sometimes i just cry and hes not even on my mind... but i think its because i just forget why im sad and it all comes out and i dont even know why im crying. i feel depressed. i usually love to draw but lately i cant anymore. i feel like theres so much i could do but i cant reach it.. . im scared to tell him my true feelings. because.. im afraid he'll make another false promise. he lies to me all the time and i feel like if i tell him, he'll just leave me... or wont do anything to fix it. i just want my dad. the one i used to know back.. i want answers so i can at least feel a bit better.. i dont want stupid lies but i mean, i dont know how to come out and say this to him. id be speaking for my sisters too. i want to fix it i want to fix everything and maybe help my sisters too. . today was my one year anniversary with my boyfriend. i know im young, but i love him so much. honestly. he tries to help me in any way he can, and now hes starting to think that hes the one causing me this emptiness. sometimes i feel like it is him. but maybe thats just because my mind is clouded over and i need someone else to blame because my dad is 'too perfect' to hurt me. i feel empty when im around my boyfriend sometimes.. but he still makes me laugh and i still love being around him. its just.. im pretty sure its my dad.. hes caused me so much damn pain and it hurts so bad. hes got a new life, so that gives him a reason to lie to me and do stuff behind my back and basically just throw me away because im 16 and i dont legally HAVE to see him now that im an adult??? what the fuck should i do.. im in so much pain i just dont know what to do with my life. i want him to love me... ive thought of suicide many times, but, i feel like that would be worthless. im sorry it was so long if anyone even bothered to read this which probably no one has....

"I wrote a bunch of different variations of (kind of detailed) suicide notes and pieces about it, read if you want. Writing has helped me calm down a littleNote 1: the philosopher. There really isn’t a point to life. If I spend my entire existence trying to help people, the people I helped will just die off with time. I will die, they will die, and any memory of us will die too. But the earth will go on. Nature will continue, uninterrupted by my demise. Unflinching. The trees will never fear their own mortality. I will rot into their soil and they will grow stronger from my decomposing corpse. . So why is it that we value human life above all else? Why is your soul worth more than the rabbit under the ferns if you will both be eaten by the same worms, if you will become the same dust? Is it a basic myth that we tell ourselves to justify our violence against other creatures? . What is the logic of people who think they’ve found their purpose? Do they believe that they will make a lasting difference? A few generations, sure, but nothing lasts. Everything we know today will one day crumble under the feet of new generations, forgotten like the birthdays of extended families.. . Note 2: the fml. I’ve been thinking about Andrew a lot lately. Is this how he felt? Is this the fate we left him too?. No, probably not. He had more problems than I do. I just consider suicide after every heartbreak because is living really worth going through this again.  . I don’t want to start over again. I don’t want to start a new life in a new city and make new friends. I never want to fall in love again. I don’t want to feel like this when it all falls apart. I don’t want to feel this pain again.. I know you’re saying that my life won’t fall apart like this again, but you’re wrong. It’s happened before. I fuck up the same way every time and I can’t stop. I’m lucky if someone stays my friend for a few months at this point. . I can’t handle the cycles of my own life. I probably need to be medicated, institutionalized, lobotomized for my own good. . I’ve craved death for a long time and I don’t know what’s different about now. Maybe I’m getting weaker with age. Oh well. . . Note 3: the bae. Justin,. Im sorry.. I don’t want you to think this was your fault.. It wasn’t.. I love you. . I loved you. . But I fucked up. I fucked everything up like I always do and I can’t live with myself knowing that. I want you to be happy. Forget about me. Please. . This is the third time I’ve tried writing this note, but it’s the only one addressed to you. I was trying to pretend that you weren’t the most important thing in my life when I was writing those and it just felt wrong. . So I have to write to you. . Just you.. The plane tickets I bought for this summer in Europe are in my name, but I want you to take them. Go for me. Ask my dad for my laptop and everything should still be logged in for you. The password is ********. I didn’t want to see the world alone anyways.. While you’re in my email, please email Kathy ***** and let her know what has happened. She is a good friend of mine and I don’t want her to think I am ignoring her. She does not deserve that. . You can have whatever you want from my stuff, just please make sure that my great grandmother’s wedding ring makes it back to my mom. It’s in the jewelry box next to my bed. . Your shirts should be in my laundry bin. They’re clean but I couldn’t keep looking at them, so they’re there. . I’m sorry to leave you with this. You shouldn’t be responsible for me anymore but I’m afraid you’re the only person I trust to do it. . I don’t know when exactly I’ll do it yet. I was planning on jumping off of the bridge when I’m in San Francisco but it would cost my family a lot to ship my body home once it’s found. Maybe I’ll ******** or ******* myself to death. We’ll see. . I should have talked to you when we were together but I just brushed our problems under the rug like they never even existed. I guess that was my biggest mistake. I’m sorry that I hurt you that way, I should have been there for you. I should have been by your side. I wish you could know the real me. I spent so much time trying to pretend I was normal so that you might be able to love me that I never really got to know you either. I guess, if you want, you can read my journals and letters. All they will tell you is that I have been very, very sad for a long time. . Please know that this wasn’t your fault. You did what you thought was best for you and that’s exactly what you should have done. I was not good for you. . Give your cats some pats for me. . Until we meet again,. . Note 4: the formal apology . This is not your fault. This is not anyone’s fault but my own. I wasn’t strong enough to handle the things that I brought onto myself, even with all of the help in the world. . I am sorry to put my friends and family through what I know is to come of this, but I hope they all understand that this is for the best. . Layla, Chris,... I am sorry to put you through this again. No one should have to face that kind of loss, but I am unable to handle myself. I have no will to live to see another day, another sunset, another first kiss. The light does not outweigh the dark in my life, and if the same is true in your own life, I hope that you are stronger than I have been. . The people I once thought to be my friends no longer care to say hello to me in passing. Many of the people who I once loved and called my friends distrust and, in some cases, despise me. It hurts me to remember what once was, knowing that the loss of the things that once made my life live-able has resulted from my own actions. I have tried to be better but I have failed.. Mom, Dad... I am sorry that you have to burry a child and I am sorry that I will not live long enough to make you as proud as I has once hoped I would. Now, at least, you can worry about yourselves and find happiness. I am also sorry for the people that helped raise me, the family members and teachers and neighbors with whom I was extraordinarily close. I hope they know that they have not failed me, but I them. . I apologize the most for the friends I rarely see. My penn pals, my long time no sees. They will wonder where I have gone. Someone who has access to my laptop, please let Kathy **** know what has happened to me. Her email should be in a folder labeled pen pals. She is a good friend, and has been for many years, and I do not want her to think that I have left her. She does not deserve that. . On the other hand, please do not idolize this. I was hated by many, disliked by even more. Please do not allow those who belittled, attacked and degraded me use my death as a tool for dealing with their fears of their own mortalities. If they did not already know that this was coming, they were not a friend. I am not asking for blame because that will just be more painful, but please, don’t lie to make yourselves feel better about this. Come to terms with yourselves. If you must blame someone, blame me. If you want to blame truthfully, blame society.  . Those friends who knew this was coming will probably be hit the hardest. I am sorry. There is nothing that they could’ve done. I have struggled with depression for many years. I began self harming in elementary school, more notably as I grew older. I have abused drugs and alcohol and men for years in order to deal with my emotional issues. To those I have caused suffering in trying to deal with this— Anthony, Justin— I am, again, sorry. Although I have tried to hide the issues in my life from those around me, it has become increasingly difficult for me, so it is likely that you suspected this. I don’t need to list every terrible thing that has ever happened to me to justify my choices— many of you already know— and if I did do so it would likely be seen as manipulative. Yes, I have sought out psychiatric help and therapy, I’ve tried every outlet for my emotions... art, writing, music, sports, sex, drugs, love... and it has been ineffective. I have developed digestion and joint issues as a result of my stress. I often cry so hard that I throw up. Although I have been very happy, I am more often than not very, very sad. . There are some people who chose to abandon me even knowing that this was coming, some of which I know care very much about me and are trying to help themselves. I am sorry to have pushed you away. I would have liked very much for our relationships to have ended on a higher note. . I am disappointed in myself and my actions throughout my lifetime and have come to realize that no number of good deeds will have me forget this. I have been a bad granddaughter, a bad student, a bad peer, a bad friend, and a bad girlfriend. I realize now that my past cannot be shaken. It seems that journalism, the only thing I truly thrived in, brought only more unhappiness to my social standing despite my love for it. This letter is probably my least edited piece of writing. . This looks much more like an apology than what it truly is, but that is because suicide is often miscommunicated. I am not doing this because of my last heart break or a bad grade or anything so trivial. I do not want anyone to be blamed for this, I did everything I could to make sure no one would be able to stop me. Please do not say I had a bright future ahead of me— those who have known me well know that this is the only ending I have available to myself, it was just a matter of when. It could’ve been twenty years from now, but I would have just suffered longer.. Although there are people to whom I would like to write individually, I have chosen not to do so to spare their psyches. I don’t want to pour my heart out when it wouldn’t change anything. I know this because, in the most relevant cases, I already have. If they want to hear from me again, give them my rough drafts and my journals. There is enough for another 20 years of conversation with me, at least. . I have contemplated this for many years and I am sorry to leave you all with this emotional burden. . I wish you the best,. . Note 5: pov. I am standing on the San Francisco Bay bridge and I will not survive my jump. . Tomorrow, or maybe next week depending on the tides, they will find my body on the rocky shoreline.  My white lace dress will be heavy with cold Pacific water and my skin will be marked with scratches from the sea floor. Maybe my eyes will have rotted out by then, or have been taken by seagulls. I may not look like myself, but myself is not happy and I will be happy.. I am in the city for a convention. I tell my roommates that I am leaving to take photos of the sun over the Bay. I will not come back.. Although I look very put together on the convention floor, my friends at home know that I am not. If they haven’t already accepted it, they have a feeling in the back of their mind that I will not be coming home.    . . . . . ",suicide

"An interesting titleIt’s so hard to handle. My entire life has been a huge trainwreck. Since young, my father would alternate between talking to me about bands to hitting me when just out of nowhere. My brother molested me when I was younger, too, and my mother did her best but to this day still tries to justify everything. All my childhood I remember just getting blamed for everything that went wrong in their day. All I can do at this age is lock myself in my room with a knife by my side and try my best to avoid them on a daily basis, which is easier now that they simply ignore me and I simply ignore them. I love my mother but I do believe she is stuck in a bad situation, so she just lets me do whatever I want, and when I bring up my depression and suicide to her, she just says that we’ll go see the psychiatrist soon, or chokes it up to teenage angst. The medication that I take just makes me slower and calmer, but it doesn’t make me any less suicidal. I have been skipping my medication and I realized that I’m more productive, but just as suicidal. I don’t care if I’m angry. I don’t care if I’m violent. I just don’t want anything to slow me down, if it’s not even going to help my pain. Everyday I wish I could just numb myself and keep on going. I never had close friends I can talk to. They all just brush me away. The last time I told one of them I wanted to end my life, all I got in reply was a “same”. I’m so fucking lonely, yet I want to be alone. I’ve attempted suicide many times now, but I always end up throwing up or failing, waking up healthy the next morning. I wish I had a gun to blow my brains out, but I can’t attain a gun where I live. The only reason I’m holding out for a short while is because I don’t want to hurt my mother, and since my boyfriend is not in town I want to see him one last time before I do it, and also that it’s a sin based on my religion, but I don’t think that matters because I’ve already attempted it. I hate being alive. I don’t see a future. Everyone leaves me. I’m sure my boyfriend will leave when he gets sick of me. I don’t think I’m good enough. I think my mother is already tired of me. I want to sleep. My dreams are always fun. A few nights ago I dreamt of this same guy I dream about and a younger version of myself going to an old penny arcade. I hated waking up from that. When I was young, all I wanted was a nuclear family and I always worked towards that, but now all I am is tired and I feel like I’m trapped inside a wall that I can never fucking leave. ",suicide

"A loss I hoped I wouldn't have to suffer for awhile. I'm more calm than I thought I would be right now. Because, I watched my grandma's last bird slowly descend to lifelessness, hearing the small and heartbreaking squawks and chirps. There were two, a male and female. The female had died first(both died same day/today) albeit confusingly because we didn't know how she did. In the male's case, he was just up on a perch, twitching and rocking himself sort of as we carefully disposes of the female. . . Soon after, the male had flown down to the floor of the cage and continued the twitching and rocking. Then he almost laid flat on his stomach after my mom checked on him real quick. What happened next was sad, to me anyway, he slightly spread his wings and held his head up and started making small chirps and squawks, which weren't too loud, but were heartbreaking to me. After that, he died right there in the cage. . . I just wanted to share with you all. I will be ok and so will my mom and grandma.",non-suicide

"I (21m) dont know how I can further improve from what ive already done. I am too ugly to date and it has been such a frustrating and demoralizing experience. I’ve done everything in my power to fix it, I’ve lost 80 pounds, I bought all new clothes, I bought a car, I’ve held a job down for over a year, I go to college, none of this even matters. I’m still so ugly that it just doesn’t make sense for any woman to settle for me when they can find anyone with the same traits as myself but aren’t repulsive.. . I’ve been on tinder (paying for gold since March), bumble, okcupid, and hinge since October and between all of those apps I have around 10 matches combined between them and 0 dates. I’ve had my friends take pictures of me, help me write a bio, and I had my friends who are girls who are pretty experienced with dating apps look over my profiles, but none of that matters if you’re as ugly as me. I’ve asked out girls in person as well, the last three were people I would consider good friends of mine and they all three said yes. Not a single one of them showed up and not a single one of them told me beforehand that they weren’t coming, I’m not worth the effort I guess.. . I’m very good with people, I have two different friend groups who invite me out to be the “funny guy”. I have lots of girls who are great friends with me but when I ask them out they want nothing to do with me. For example, I’ve asked three girls who were good friends with me in the last 6 or 7 months and they’ve all said yes, each time they’ve seemed very excited to go out with me but out of all of those times none of them even told me they weren’t coming, I’m not even worth knowing that you don’t want to see me, I’m worthless.. . I don’t even have anyone I can turn to, even my mom and sister told me that despite losing 80 pounds that I’m still a 2/10. What else am I supposed to do at this point? I’d get plastic surgery but I’ll never be able to afford it. I just feel like my only purpose is to be an inconvenience to women who are looking for men who aren’t subhuman vermin.

"I can’t stop thinking about ending my life (story added)I really have no one to talk about this with because a lot of people are effected by it. Two of my best friends killed themselves in 2017, and although I feel incredibly selfish, all I have wanted to do is end my own life. I can’t tell others because of how selfish it really is, and I know how badly it effects others. But at this point, they can get over it. I’m not a priority in anybody’s life. My boyfriend broke up with me, I fuck up everything good for me, and I live a life filled with misery due to my overthinking. For an entire year I’ve been suicidal and I have tried everything to try to cope with the unbearable depression and anxiety. For 7 years I’ve dealt with a somewhat bearable diagnosis of depression and anxiety. I’ve tried all different kinds of therapy and I know it takes time, but it’s all been a complete waste of time even with a positive outlook. I’ve been on medicine for months, and the only thing it has helped with is my anger, and completely making me numb. I used to be a 4.0 student, and now I’m failing all my classes because I truly can’t see a point to anything. We all die right? Either kill yourself or get killed. Nothing matters in the end. I can’t even do things that used to make me happy because they do not make me happy anymore. So why live a life with no meaning and with no drive to create a meaning? I believe this life isn’t for me, and maybe my soul can find its meaning somewhere in this universe. But here, on this earth, I have no meaning. I find myself drunk most nights to rid myself of fear, because of course I’m scared of dying. But wow there is not a single point in living anymore, so why prolong the inevitable?

Balding want to end it all.I'm 28 and going bald and can't live with it anymore. Some people say shave your head and lift. Which doesn't feel me. Nor does the jacked up bald guy suit my personality one bit. Plus if I shaved my head being a pale skinny white guy I'd just look like a Neo-Nazi or cancer patient. The only hair style options for balding men is to either shave it or let it grow slightly out. Which makes you look like a 40 something accountant who's idea of fun is to reorganize his stamp collection. I'm terrified of leaving the house without a hat as I know everywhere I go people laugh at me for balding. I've given up on pursing women because no attractive women in her right mind wants to date a balding 20-something when 90% of guys in their 20's have full heads of hair. I can't go on with life like this anymore as I've gone from being considered good looking to ugly. I'm trying rogaine and if I don't see it working a year from now I'll just kill myself as I don't want to go through life as an ugly bald loser. And that's what baldness does to you. People give examples of how bald men are attractive but it's always hypermasculine guys like The Rock or Vin Diesel who are also in their 40's which is of no help for a guy in his 20's.,suicide

Here's what I think happens after death There are two scenarios depending on your behaviour in life. . If you're a good person and don't cause a lot of needless suffering: you become nothing but consciousness and senses.then you will gain the knowledge of anything and everything that has is and will ever exist. You then can choose to reincarnate as whatever or whoever you want from whenever time period. But before you are reincarnated your memories and consciousness are completely obliviated and your life is placed into whatever you choose.. . If you are a bad person and cause a lot of needless suffering: your consciousness and memories are obliviated and you get reincarnated as something completely random. Your punishment is lack of choice.,non-suicide
"Help?Thanks ahead of time to anyone who reads this wall of text I'm about to write.. . &amp;#x200B;. . This will be the first time I speak up. Around age 18 I had an episode of what I thought was dying. It was my very 1st panic attack. I proceeded to go to the ER 26 times that month convinced I was dying and they were missing whatever it was. Nothing was the same since that day. I wake up feeling cloudy and out of it every day. Can't concentrate on anything. My whole life shut down that day.. .  Fast forward to age 25. Gone nowhere in life, can't. Developed massive phobias, hardly leave the house. Public is just one fear after another till I feel dizzy. One day my heart starts doing this weird thing. Kind of skipping, lasts an hour. I go to er and it stops as I walk in. They do tests and they show hypothyroidism. Recommend I see my primary. I do so and am prescribed Levothyroxine(synthroid). A month later was like a miracle. No more panic. Still have phobia thoughts but without the wave of panic it's like nothing. Can ignore it as just a passing thought. I think my whole life is turning around. I even went on vacation to Florida later that year which involved taking a plane. This would've been unheard of for me up until now. Only thing bothering me is I'm still getting weird episodes of flutters in my chest occasionally.. . Fast forward to age 28. Flutters happening more and more often, lasting longer ect. ER still hasn't been able to catch one on the monitor. One morning I wake up and grab some water. Sit down to start my wake up routine when suddenly I get a feeling like I've been kicked in the stomach. My heart starts racing. Not panic racing, dangerous racing. I call the EMS. My heart rate was hitting 270 then jumping to sinus then back to the 200's. I felt like I was dying, blacked out several times on the way to the hospital. This was my 1st AFIB attack. I began having at least one a week. Most terrifying experience of my life. This went on for about a year before it was finally deemed serious enough for surgery. Had surgery in October, successful. Issue is this has brought all the panic back full force, except now the panic comes with PAC/PVC's(heart ""skips"") with it.  I've also learned that having AFIB at my age makes me super likely to have heart failure at some point. God knows when.. . Long story short the panic ans anxiety has left me feeling suicidal for many many years. I've kept it to myself because I already felt like a burden to my family I didn't want to make it worse on them. When I thought things were getting better I was happy for the 1st time in 8 years. Now this with heart problem I'm feeling it more then ever. I'm 29 and still live with my mother because I haven't been able to establish my own life since all this started. It's killing me. I'm going nowhere fast with no hope on the horizon. The only joy is that somewhere in the worst of it I met the best girl in the world. She's the only reason I haven't killed myself yet. I can't imagine what it would do to her. I feel like life it stacked against me at every turn. I try so hard to look for some signs of things getting better but nothing. I'm scared. Not only that I'll do it but of the future too. I'm scared to kill myself because I don't to hurt my loved ones but I'm scared of the future and what kind of hellish deterioration my heart will do to me. I've fought so long to just hold on and ride it out. It's done nothing but get worse. I'm losing this war.. . PS: I wrote this an hour ago.

Anridepressants, ritalin, antipsychotic, sleeping pills...I got drunk in the beginning of August, came home and tried to die by slashing my wrists open...failed, of course...Now my parents look at me like I could break at any second, they're always worried and they're always suffering, they feel like it's their fault I'm sad. They shouldn't have to deal with this shit. . . I can't get into a good university, I can't be there for my friends, I can't make my parents happy, I feel  worried toxic around my niece, I can't even take fucking care of myself. My reflection disgusts me and my voice annoys me. Life is shit, we suffer so much why should one continue to live??? It's exhausting I wish I could just fucking stop living.  ",suicide
"I'm not afraid to die just afraid of failing and painThis is by no means a plea for help. I've been thinking about suicide for a long time, intermittently of course with intensity following traumatic episodes. Truthfully, on a philosophical level I feel ready to die. I don't have motivation to live on as I view myself as an ethical problem in the first place, just by the fact that I'm alive and contributing to the suffering of others just by merit of that. Also, I have no true close friends and the man I have feelings for has been driven to exhaustion by me. Another reason. My family would do better financially and morally without me. There's no one who needs me or depends on me aside from my plants whom I can give to charity. Death is my choice and it's been calling for quite sometimes.. . The problem is that non assisted suicide comes with a set of risks I'm very scared of. 1) ending up with brain damage 2) accidentally hurting others in the process. I feel trapped in my human body. I want to escape. I wish society made it easier to opt out instead of guilt tripping us that we should stay alive and that a life of misery is better than going out gracefully and leaving people the best version of yourself. Which is what I want.",suicide

"No friends, no social life, no family only my diseased dogI'm quite the insecure guy and it feels like i have nothing to live for. my family is deprived whereas my mother gave in to cancer pretty quickly. This happened four years ago. My dad had a weak heart so when he found out that my mom died, he got a heart attack and has been ill ever since. I dont feel like have anything to live for anymore. My dog has got various infections and is soon to pass, since he is 8 human years. I got no friends, nor a social life, and I feel like everyone is rejecting me because I'm different. School is not going so well and what i mainly do is calling in sick and stay home. The teacher in school hasn't set up a class map so we can pick our seats. This was the worst case scenario for me where I don't have anyone to sit with. Im on the brink of giving up. All that keeps me going is the loving dog I still have, and my father is not able to satisfy my very needs. I have a job and have to work for every penny so I can continue to live on. Im sure that my father nor my dog has much time left. I feel like the only place I belong is in the animes I watch. I wish i could end my life and travel to a better world with no rejection or demands. I seriously don't know what to do anymore. Im barely holding my life together and I dont have anyone to talk to. I've never talked to a girl except for one fucking time. That was when a girl asked me whether we had homework for friday or not. Im not used to talking with people so I didn't reply. I miss my mother, and her hugs and love. I don't know what I can do to force myself to live on. I just want someone to talk to. Nobody has the same interests as I do. The world will be better off without me. Nobody will ever notice i'm gone either way. Im thinking of comitting suicide but Im scared and I have not lived long enough to experience anything. I feel shrouded in darkness and just want to die. Somebody, please talk to me. I just need someone because I don't have anything nor anyone. My sadness has the upper hand and now Im thinking of why I was born into this miserable world. I didn't ask for this. I hate my life. I have nobody. Surely I will end my misery soon. ",suicide

"Schools (atleast American schools, I can't speak for others) need to start making teachers coordinate with how much work they are assigning and meeting preset limits on hw. This year has been hell and schools have just been feeding the fire with so much, but one of, if not the biggest issue is large amounts of homework. Students can't work on their social life, clubs and sports, or learning valuable skills outside of school, fit in time to focus on yourself and mental health, or even sleep a lot of the time. Our schedules and mental health are being crushed by teachers who all in all need to do little work with what they have assigned (I have seen the grading process, it isn't hard and has no mental or physical strain, it's just kind of tedious). . Not giving a generation time to work on outer life skills and hobbies like cooking, maintenance, basic plumbing, electric work, maintenance, joining the labor force and internships, killing club and extracurricular participation, and more due to large amounts of homework on top of everything that's going on right now is setting us up for failure with lack of life and social skills, and it pains me there is such a simple solution right there.. . If schools would simply put a cap on homework length, they could determine it by question, pages, estimated time taken, etc. If a few teachers need to put more out they put it out there too faculty and discuss what larger assignments can be moved back or modified. I am not looking to get rid of essays and the like, but I doubt I need 7 pages of chem alone after each class period, and that's not even considering everything else.. . I know I can't do all that much but I just wanted to share my thoughts. We are witnessing so many members of this generation being set up for failure in many aspects of life and it is also greatly affecting our mental health and safety, there have been 3 teen suicides in my town this month alone (descent size, under 60,000 over 30,000) I am just sick of useless faculty not considering students as human beings and just as robots that can do as much work as assigned, they work off of the equation more homework+ students = higher test scores and more money to blow on sports and I am sick of it.",non-suicide

SuicideI think there should be a choice if you want to end your life and doctors or nhs should give it to you so you can die peacefully.

"Finally leaving r/SuicideWatchFor the longest time, I had been ridiculously unhappy with my life. I knew the moment I hit rock bottom was the day I woke up and just...didn't feel happy anymore. It was such a foreign feeling, like I had just lost the feeling of being alive . . I thought that feeling would never go away, or that I was exaggerating, because I had been through much worse before this. It just seemed like everything was going wrong at the same time, and life would never be joyous again. . . I had my entire plan written out and ready to go. My note underwent countless revisions and reworkings, because I didn't want anyone to think it was their fault. I even gave myself a deadline.. . I said, if things didn't work out by my 18th birthday, I'm killing myself. . . I'm not 18 yet, still have a few months to go, but I can now say with certainty that those days are over for me. I don't know what happened. I didn't even realize it happened. I just woke up again one morning and thought, *I don't mind being alive*.. . I used to frequent here a lot on another account, but over the months I've slowly just...stopped coming, yet never officially separated myself from this subreddit. . . But now, it's time. This is my official withdrawing from r/SuicideWatch. Not because I'm ending my life tonight, but because I'm starting it again.. . I'm glad I no longer feel this way.

"I have no friends. Being lonely hurts.I'm a freshman in college who's on winter break. I literally have no friends to talk to. Had many friends in high school, but never good ones. That's why I haven't kept in touch with anyone in high school. Honestly, as much as people hate this, I wish I was popular. I wish I had a lot of friends and was well-known. That way I could have something to do during winter break and the summer. In high school, I was known as the quiet kid. But my social skills have improved since then, although I'm not entirely extroverted yet.  I guess a lot of people knew me in high school (a fair amount), or at least people knew who I was. I was smart in high school, got A's and B's. I’m currently enrolled in a private university studying Mechanical Engineering. . . I'm literally in my house all winter break long right now. What do I do? I'm honestly trying to improve myself with /r/selfimprovement. I'm reading a lot, playing the guitar, working out, and overall paying more attention to my self-image. But, some days I just stay in bed all day and browse the internet. Or ever worse just pull an all nighter just watching movies all day. . . I don't want to make to seem like I'm isolated from society. I have a HUGE family, lots of cousins, aunts, uncles, etc. Therefore, most of the holidays and breaks, I just hang out with my cousins playing video games, going to the movies, playing soccer, or doing some sort of social event. But, I'm not happy. I love my family to death, but we have nothing in common, we just hang out because we're cousins and thats it. Like I mentioned earlier, a lot of people knew me in high school but that's because they were the friends of my cousins. I would hang out with my cousins a lot, therefore I would meet their friends. . . Somedays, I just daydream of becoming a celebrity, or a pro soccer player where I'll feel like I'm wanted. Where people from high school would be surprised of what I became. Or they'll say, ""Wow, I remember that guy."" But, daydreaming is far from reality. I use social media, but I don't have a lot of followers/friends. I have less than 100 followers on Instagram and that says something to me. It says that I'm not popular and I'm a loner. I barely get likes on any of my post. I know you may get annoyed that I'm craving for likes, but seriously, I'm not. I just want to feel wanted. Some days, I just scroll pass Instagram looking at my high school classmates and I get depressed. Most of them have tons of pictures with their friends and living their joyful life - and I'm just sitting here at home or at my college dorm. It really gets to me. . . My college roommate probably doesn't even like me. He has his own set of friends and I meet every one of them because I'm always in our dorm. I don't think he wants to hang out with me because I'm not cool enough. My other college hall mates are very nice to me and always ask how my day was and they're always really excited to see me. But they *rarely* ask me to hang out or tend to leave me out of things. They rarely invite to me dinner, therefore I eat all my meals alone while listening to music. . . You don't even know how many times I've cried myself to sleep thinking about how lonely I am and that I'll graduate college as a loner again. I don't want to graduate college without making good friends/life lasting friendships but people never want to hang out with me, and it really hurts. I don't even have friends to go to the mall. A few months ago, I went to the mall alone and I saw one of my cousins there. We talked and then he asked if I was with anyone. I said no and he jokely said, ""Wow, loner!"" I know he was joking but that really got to me. I drove home just staring mindlessly at the road thinking if I should just slam my car onto the side of the road and kill myself. Yes, I have suicidal thoughts from time to time, but never went to the doctor about it. . . I just want to feel wanted by other people. I want to have friends, not be a loner anymore. I don't think I'll make it pass the age of 20 at this state, honestly. Yes, a lot of people will miss me, but sometimes loneliness just gets through you. Please give me advice or tell me it gets better with your own personal experience. I need help.",suicide

"My Son (10)Typing this is difficult for me. My son is such a bright and cheerful kid I never thought I would be dealing with this. I automatically default to the theory that he is lying, or just trying for attention, but I don't want to be wrong.. A little back ground, I don't know if it is relevant but I want to make sure I am telling the whole story so anyone reading can give me their honest opinion. My son's mother and I were high school sweethearts. We split shortly after high school and both started seeing other people. About two years later we were both single and  produced this little boy. We weren't together at the time but went into this knowing we would make the best of it. It didn't go well. After she got pregnant we talked about a relationship for a bit but it was very clear that we just weren't going to be able to make it work. After my son was born I moved on but tried to be there for them. My ex made life a living hell. Fast forward 10 years we are both married and have other children. My ex mostly communicates with my wife, we rarely talk. . Two weeks ago my son is at his cousins house and they are playing video games. Something happens in the game and he gets frustrated and slams the controller down resulting in a broken remote. His uncle tells him since now they don't have enough controllers for everyone to play he will have to sit out, his uncle then leaves the room. A few minutes later my brother hears the kids screaming and runs back to find that my son has wrapped a belt around his neck and is pulling it tightly. After defusing the situation my brother calls me and my ex over and explains to us what has happened. My sons reasoning was that he feels he has made too many mistakes in life and is tired of failing. The thing is he is the kid that never gets in trouble, he is an A-B student, plays football, is extremely respectful, very well spoken, he gets compliments everywhere he goes. . At the end of the conversation we agree that it is best to bring him to a professional and let him talk to someone. We tell our son this and ask him to keep this between us until we do. Well he goes to school and tells all his friends and that he tried to commit suicide over the weekend. Of course this prompts a call from school where we are asked not to bring him back to school until he has talked to someone. . Monday a week ago was his first appointment. The Dr called us to the back and had my son and I sit together in a room while he asked him a series of questions. He answered them as if he was taking a test and knew all the answers. It was very clear he wasn't being truthful. At the end of the appointment he clears him to go back to school but schedules a followup visit with another Dr in the  office.. Upon returning to school my son again starts talking to all his friends about whats going on. He also tell one of his teachers about what is happening and that he had to go talk to a Dr but he wasn't comfortable so he wasn't truthful to the Dr. His mother and I decided to try and take some sort of action. We restricted his access to his video games to try and ensure he was spending more time around family members rather than alone in his room playing games. We also though it would be sort of an incentive for him to get better. We saw no change throughout the week, and went to his second appointment yesterday.. His mother took him to this appointment, and it ended with the Dr telling her she needed to bring him into the children's hospital and have him admitted and tested. We haven't done that yet because neither of us believe what he is telling the Drs. When the 2nd Dr asked him what he had lied to the 1st Dr about he admitted that during the portion of questions where the 1st Dr asked if there was anything in his life he would like change my son's answer was a lie. He originally told the first Dr that there was nothing that he wanted to change. When questioned by the 2nd Dr he admitted that at his Mom's house he would like more milk, and more time to play with his little sister. He also said that while at my house he wanted his step brother to be nicer to him, and that he no longer wanted to come to my house on Thursdays (which is part of our custody agreement). This brings us to today and we are at a loss.. We aren't sure where to go from here. His mother and I both feel as if he over reacted when he broke the controller and at this point he feels if he comes clean he will be in trouble. We don't want to just tell him that because we don't want him to feel like we are calling him a liar. we are trying to be as supportive as we can but are worried he is seeing all this attention as positive attention and that is what is driving him to keep up with the story. So at this point we are stuck. Any advice from anyone here who knows anything about this and can offer any advice we would appreciate it. . . edit1: Update. School called me in on Wednesday and asked that he once again not return to school until he actually goes to a hospital and gets a clean bill of health. After much debate and feeling like I am failing his mother and I brought him yesterday. They committed him. I'm dying inside, they essentially took my son. I know it is for his own good but I feel like a complete failure. I feel as if I wasn't there to protect him. Most of all I am kind of numb, I just don't know. We brought him in through the ER and the Dr spoke with him privately. I'm not sure what he told the Dr but it warranted action. He signed a PEC and at that point we couldn't take him home even if we wanted to. Last night was his first night, I get to call at 11:15 am CST to check on him. The nurse who checked him in said the average stay there is 5-7 days. I failed.",suicide

But I know I wont take this for long anymore. Every single day I'm thinking of commiting suicide because if I did that all my problems will be gone, I tried psychiatrist but it didnt help. I cant talk to anyone about my weakness and problems, im trying to act like cool guy who is fine but I'm really broken. Problem is that 8 months of breaking up has passed and I think I love my ex gf more, with every each day I'm falling deeper into that and I just wanna die. I had some hobbies back then but I'm just suffering in my body which I hate too now, nothing can make me happy, cca 2 weeks ago I stopped talking to my parents, I stopped talking to classmates, probably everyone expect my friend. But I think im just fucking it up, I really want to die but I'm afraid, not of that but of failure ",suicide
"I’m really anxious for school The title describes what I’m talking about (as titles do) but basically, my mother is forcing me to go back in person, (mom and dad divorced, mom got custody) and it’s not even the whole virus thing that makes me super anxious. Of course I’m nervous about getting the virus, all that stuff. (I live in the shitshow of a country called the U. S.). But that’s not the big thing that makes me anxious. I am very much an introvert, so this quarantine has kinda been my dream. Sitting at home all summer, playing games and watching YouTube videos? Hell yeah, sign me up. So when I think about going back to school I can’t help but feel anxious about how little free time I am going to have. My school starts at 9:30, and ends at 4:20. When I get home, I have at least 2 hours of homework every night, and then it’s usually time to start making/eating dinner, I watch TV for like 30 minutes, and then it’s time to go and take a shower, and get ready for bed. Like, there is no time in the day for me to just chill out and watch YouTube videos, play Minecraft, just do the things that I enjoy and use to destress. And during the weekend, I usually have very little time. 2. Short. Days. That’s all I have during the week to myself. And then it usually takes about half a day to go and see my horse (he doesn’t live on our property, he lives about 30 mins away) and then it takes at least 2 hours to finish all the chores my mom assigns me, and another 2 to do my laundry. Then cue the whole dinner thing again, and that’s an entire day. Like, during the school year, I have no freedom. It’s horrible. And every year I always feel so anxious about going back to school and having my free time and hobbies stripped from me in sake of “learning”. Every year, I go through my shiny new planner and look at the dates when we have an extra day off, when spring break/winter break is, just every precious extra second I have. And it makes me depressed. During the school year, my life is just consumed with the same day over and over, and staying on a strict schedule on what I have time to do. I fucking hate it. . . (This post might sound really entitled and spoiled, but trust me, I’m in no way like that. I just really love to have some alone time, and with school, it’s always another thing on top of another thing.)",non-suicide

"About that whole “super straight thing” Form what I read it means you are not attracted to trans people, even if they identify as the gender you are attracted to, but I’ve also heard people say that being super straight is transphobic.. . Am I missing something because no way in hell is not being attracted to someone because of that transphobic, sure it wouldn’t surprise me if transphobic are also outwardly super straight. . . It seems silly to think that not being attracted to trans people= transphobic, as transphobia is intense dislike of trans people. Not attracted to≠intense dislike.. . Is is just me or do people just throw around the -phobic or -ist terms whenever someone does or says anything negative about a gender/race even if it is not racist according to every credible dictionary?. . For example I am not attracted to trans people or (generally) people outside of my respective race, but that’s because of commonalities shared, not because I have anything against them or am racist/transphobic.. .

I lost most of my ""friends"" and confidence. People called me horrible names, made jokes, told my boyfriend to leave me, and one chick lied to cover this cowardly piece of shits ass. I tried killing myself a few weeks after the rape. I called the cops because I didn't want my dad to find me. I didn't succeed. He moved. After another failed attempt at hanging myself and spending a few weeks in the hospital I decided to get my shit together. He came back today. My ""friend"" is with him partying it up. I don't know.

"Here because I can't see a counsellor - adult bullyingI am in a horrible and complicated situation right now. I am here because I don't have any options at the moment other than the crisis county hotline and I didn't find it helpful. . . TL;DR I am in my late twenties and dealing with bullying after high school/college. . . I'm being bullied almost regularly by a young guy next door at my parents house, as well as a couple about my age at the apartment where I only stay for for three days a week for my job. Can't stay there because neighbours are abusive toward me, shout insults, follow me around (upstairs) stomping and throwing things. They leave bags of garbage outside the door, and husband has threatened me by staring at me while punching their front door repeatedly, going out and punching my garbage can under the window of my unit, and threatening me with his fucking huge truck while I was crossing the street – He had plenty of leeway when I started crossing, sped up and leaned on his horn. Left me shaken.. . Here's where it gets really weird. The wife of this couple was in my grade 12 math class. They look old now and it makes me wonder if she was one of those people who stayed back an extra year. We hardly spoke to each other but she seemed alright, didn't ever pick on me back then. She remembered me before I remembered her. Now she and him are my neighbours. . . I am on disability for mental illness - agoraphobia, social anxiety, depression and panic attacks. A lot of it is a result of trauma from school bullying I experienced for several years. They know this because they've seen my mail. . . They say horrible things to me like after I use the bathroom they say I'm fucking dirty. I turn on the sink to block them out even though I know that is bad too, wasting water. I don't have a sound machine but plan to get one. If I am in the kitchen they get furious and start stomping and swearing sometimes, tell me to stfu. If they hear me eating they call me a pig or something along that line even though I'm thin. I basically tiptoe around the unit because I don't want to draw their attention. . . Stuff from landlord as well - I have given up texting him about their garbage because he lies that he took care of it when it's sitting there in front of my door. There was also a really bizarre incident in the summer where I think he used and destroyed the toilet while I was away and it had to be replaced. I believe it was him because he said he had to fix the roof and asked if I would be away and I said yes. He's the only other person with a key. It is deeply fucked up. . . Now this guy at my parent's house is giving me a hard time, getting worse every year with insults. His bedroom window is always open because he's a hockey player and he shouts insults at me like ""Go fuck your mother"" because as a result of my handicap I can't drive and I often get rides from my mom. He says sexual slurs like the c word and stuff like that. It's great. He is younger than me and would say mean things to me sometimes like call me a psycho when we were kids but thought he would grow out of it. Nope, he shaved his head, got fit and now is an even bigger bully. . . I am at a loss of how to deal with this. So that's why I'm here. I feel like I've gotten paranoid as a result of the constant abuse from these people. I have zero self esteem, just feel like garbage about myself like I went to college and it was amazing, am an off-and-on freelance artist now but am terrible at staying consistent with producing art and staying in touch with the local art store. I have sold stuff at local art shows and it was great but I didn't go to any of them this year because I've been struggling.

No one there really likes me very much, and I have a bad habit of being mean when I feel threatened.. . Diagnosis: I’ve been in and out of therapy for about 7 years, and I take medication. Officially I have severe depression, anxiety, and paranoid episodes.. . . Work life: Basically, right now I’m not doing what I want to do at all. I’m stuck doing a job I hate, with people I don’t care for, and making shit money.

However. my mom is constantly on my ass about how I should be trying to move out, pay more of my bills, take on responsibility, etc. I am the oldest and I have younger siblings who would be devastated if anything happened to me.. . . However, in spite of everything I just feel so worn down, defeated, and depressed. Sometimes I wish I could just do it, and end this miserable existence of mine.. . . I’m in bed right now, I’m not feeling actively suicidal but I definitely do not want to be alive. I’d love some advice, thoughts, or whatever you have, if you don’t mind.. . Please and thanks. . -M. . ",suicide

"Midnight.1am. I don't like 1am. I hate it just as much as 2am, 3am, 4am. Probably even more. At 1am the bottle cracks and it all comes rushing out and I can't stop it. At 2am I can't breathe, I can't move, and I can't think. At 3am I think too much, to an uncomfortable level. I think about things I don't want to think about, but I can't stop. 4am is lonely. 4am is tiring. 4am is when I finish crying and I start breathing again and I can move, I can see, but I can't feel. 4am is lying on my side, cheeks damp and eyes bloodshot and raw, stained with red lines and my knuckles stained with purple and blue flowers that ache when you press down on them too hard. It's feeling not much but everything at the same time, it's realising that I really am nothing. It's understanding that my life and every other reject is meaningless, that when I love, laugh, FEEL; it doesn't account to anything. It's waking up and realising that I am truly alone in this life and more to come. Feeling dead in a cold room with no one around for miles, having to pick up my own pieces and haphazardly glue them back together. The whirring of the fan and the blurry eyes that come from staring at the one spot on the wall, because I can't move. I wonder what I did to make this happen to me. Why do you hate me so much? Why me? I haven't done anything wrong. So why do I deserve this? . . But 5am is coming. 5am brings salvation this morning, brings the scratchy feel of rope around my scarlet stained neck and the bitter taste of pills on my tongue. I'm not scared anymore. I don't know what I am now. I can't breathe. I can't do anything. And so I sit watching the clock, the same old ticking noise is too loud and my breathing is erratic. My nails dig into my arms and drag up the nauseating blue flowers and strikingly red stalks. Red. Too much red. All I can see is red and everything is too hot, it's all closing in on me and I can't goddamn breathe.. . . . Clatter.. . . . . . Then it's nothing. . . . I'm waiting for 5am, I can sleep at 5am.",suicide

"Loneliness just might kill meWhen I first starting writing this post I included way too much details of all the bullshit I've been through this year and through out my life. I stopped myself because...I don't want to bore you with my sob story. Long story short- in 28 years of my life I have lived to the fullest while battling major depressive disorder, ptsd and anxiety. I've been abused in all forms by people who claimed to love me, including my family. However I have also traveled, created cool art and danced a lot. Fast forward to today, I am in my cute lil apartment with my 2 cats within walking distance of my job. Im just sitting here thinking how much longer I can take this feeling of loneliness. I have a handful of people that I consider ""friends"", most of them are far away.  Its difficult for me to imagine me getting romantically close to anyone every again after my most recent relationship, which has left me traumatized and broken. I have coping skills- but they aren't working anymore. I don't know what is going on in my head or why I can't reverse this broken heart. I've been able to overcome every single relationship but this one has been rough. My chest literally hurts. Idk why I am even writing this anymore. Being heard sounds nice.",suicide

"Don't know how handle this?Wrote this in a hurry, my bad for the spellings n shit.. . So, to start off, I'll just mention I have cripling anxiety at the minute. And this didn't help my situation at all.. . A while back, me and this guy used to be close. And he liked me(told me). I don't know why i did it, I guess I was kinda jolly but I went and told a few of my friends. Baring in mind, I was pretty confident back then.. . A LOT of awful things happened over the next few months after that(not to do with him)and my anxiety was unspeakably bad. We had grown apart(probably due to me being so awkward and distant)but we didn't hate eachother. Then today in school him and his friends randomly came in and started shouting to me 'is it true you told everyone __ fancied you' and I was just taken aback but was like 'no' (baring in mind me telling people about it happened in year 9 and im in year 10 now). I know I shouldn't have said anything, but it wasn't like I meant it to hurt him. Anyway he was saying things like 'ew why would I like her, why make up a rumour about me you tragic bitch we know you're desperate'. I was pretty anxious that morning and everyone shouting to me brought on a huge panic attack. When I get them, I get them bad. I can barely function and can't even string a sentence together. I was trying to deny it when I just really wanted to call him out for bullshitting about it. What I said made it even worse. My brain flipped and made me think of things i SHOULDNT say to make the situation worse and I ended up saying them. Then he started taking the mick out of my hair and what I looked like in front of the whole class. And to make it worse, his squad joined in and started laughing. Even one of his friends, who I kinda had a thing with. That fucking hurt. My 'friend' was laughing too. He just basically made out I was desperate for him, and thanks tomy fucking anxiety, I froze and couldn't say anything to defend myself. So people do think that. My anxiety probably made this so much fucking worse. It sucks because I'm friends with everyone in that squad. Now they just think I'm fucking desperate. . . . This sounds so fucking childish, but it was awful at the fucking time. I'm already facing huge issues. I don't need any more. People already think I'm weird, fake and slutty. This didn't help. I just don't know how to face them tomorrow. They're in most of my lessons. And I have to sit next to the guy in my lessons for 3 of them. I just feel so embarrassed.

"I don't know if I need help again or I just need safe companyI'm going to keep this brief because a full story of my life is probably an invite for doxing. The cliff notes version is I've had two major depressive episodes that lead to a suicide attempt. Once when I was around ten and always stopped myself mid act. And the second, which I will be focusing on, at age 21, after two years of military service in the uscg.. . There were many reasons for why, but the biggest one is that I saw a dark future where the hazing never stopped, the preception others had would always lead to punishment on my end, and I would continue working for a group of people that would cover up anything right before my eyes. I actually know a guy with ptsd, but he can't report it because the incident was covered up. His exact words being ""we went out for a routine stop, guns loaded, and you were in the fleet so hopefully you can put two and two together."" Not only can I, but I was at the station when his boat was trying to dispose of some pappers. I could've done something, but didn't. I was looking out for myself just like everyone else was. And for good reason because the people around me would often accuse me of things I didn't do. They would also claim I was disrespect for answering a question on a board the same way I answered it to someone else the next day who did not think this. Then of course there's the hazing that sometimes involved hanging people from  a window naked or some other degradating task.. . This all lead to me looking so miserable that I was sent to rehab and threatened to end myself before leaving. This lead to a long process to get medically retired. Now I'm waiting for covid19 to pass, looking for my other half, and not finding anything. I know it's early but I'm trying to make up for lost time. Leaving rehab, knowing I was going to the civilian world had me happy, scared but happier than I was. Now I'm alone and starting to slip into my old thoughts. . . I constantly fear that I'm taking advantage of a situation I have no right to. Nothing I went through is unique. Pain was normal, I just complained about it. I fear that I'll never redeem myself for standing by all those years. I took up online dating to find someone but all that's done is remind me that I'm ugly and unlovable. And I've been lying to my doctors about it, because I'm so close to being out I don't want to go back to rehab. Somehow reddit has been the nicest place for me to talk about my feelings. Even tho everytime i do I learn something I thought was normal is horrifying to someone else. Plus I still genuinely believe most people are cruel and evil, therefore it is best to trust no one.. .

"I need some help So I’ve been with my current gf for not too long now, only about 3 months. But for a while I’ve been feeling uneasy in the relationship. It’s more of a drain on me then anything at this point. I think we both jumped the gun on this one because we kinda skipped the small talk. I know I kind of fucked up by allowing it to happen but now I’m regretting it. We share almost nothing in common. Conversations don’t really go anywhere. I feel more single than I do taken at this point. I’m sure some of you are asking “Why don’t you just break up with her?” Because she has really bad depression and really clingy. She tried doing *it* more than two times in the times I’ve been dating her.(also it’s noteworthy she flat out refuses to even try and get help) I feel as if I’m tethered to her and I’m just not happy. So if I decide to cut the cord am I the biggest douche canoe on the earth? And how can I attempt to go through with this without triggering her?

"A small update from my previous post. 11/9/2020. . So, I posted this on reddit, and someone commented on it that I am way past the point where it is ok to ask for help, but am I? That’s one thing that has always bugged me about myself, I never know when to shut up, but I also never know when to ask for help. I might just reason with myself and that’s why I don’t ask for help about stuff. I often say to myself that my life could be worse, everything could be worse, someone else has it harder than me, they are going through more pain than I will ever endure. But by thinking about that, I think about people that I have never met, never knew existed if they did, and that because they have it worse, means that I’m fine, just deal with it. But I feel like I need to think more local, but what my parents have taught me, I don’t know if I can, I don’t know if I ever will. I always think about someone who has it worse, my parents drill into me that I am very lucky, and I am, but I don’t know how lucky, I don’t know what everyone else’s life is like, they tell me that a lot too, they often say that you don’t know what their home life is like, and what they have gone through, and that has stuck with me, but it takes me over when I contemplate telling someone about my pain. If I thought more local, and based when I thought a good time to get help was, off of what I know for sure, what other peoples life have been like this year, I should have gotten at least a little a few months ago. I question my masculinity though sometimes when I think about getting help, my dad doesn’t want me to grow up to be a pussy, I don’t want that either, so by holding everything in, it makes me feel strong, because on the outside, I’m a 15 year old that weighs about 180 and has a little bit of a belly. So I’m not very physically appealing, so by holding all that in, I find that I’m mentally stronger. I like the feeling that I’m mentally strong. I honestly should have gotten help a long time ago, but as you know, my go to person sucks at responding.",non-suicide

"Idk how to title this.So I’m contemplating suicide again. Success is a lie we tell ourselves that we’ll enjoy once we’ve got it, but in actuality we’ll hate it once it’s there. If there’s a heaven or hell, it’s got to be infinitely better than whatever’s happening here. At least in hell, you can dream having something better, and in heaven you could make something better happen. But in this place, there’s nothing but what you were started with. And you can start on hard mode, or easy mode, and even then the game of life is quite shit. Because the payoff isn’t worth it. By the time you get to that payoff, you’re already dying. Meaning you literally can’t enjoy life. It is physically impossible. Because the way it works rn. Like, I understand that I might be missing hormones or whatever in my brain, and that’s why I can’t express real happiness or sadness (it’s always been feigned so I don’t look like a psychopath or a serial killer), but if there is a God, then why would he make a person so miserable and incapable of emotion that the consequences of their actions on a terrible planet will have zero effect on them because those places only provide stuff I can’t have i.e. happiness and sadness? At this point in life, I guess all I can do is try to understand why I hate existing. So, yeah. I’m thinking about suicide. And if you’re thinking, “You just gotta find what you like. You’re young, you’ll figure it out.”, I say to you: I hate people, I hate moving my ass (being tall is not that fun, trust me), and I feel like all the effort put into life is fucking stupid. You have to wake up on time, clean your body, feed your body, work for money to do those things, look decent, pay to look decent, socialize with imbeciles, sleep on time, be smart, be dumb, be strong, act weak. It’s all for what?! A fucking chance at being in a big house? A girl that just whines and acts for more, or hates you over time? A car that looks cool? It’s all a fucking sham. Too much effort for something I don’t care about. Nothing interests me in life cuz it’s all either incredibly boring, laborious, or impossible with the tools I have available. Life is just fucking misery and stress for zero payoff. And I just want out before it tricks me into thinking I have a chance at something good, when I know damn well I don’t have a chance.",suicide

"My life is falling apart. I'm hopeless. was dating a girl for 2 and a half years. I invested my heart and soul into this girl. I did everything for her. I gave her the skin off my back. She felt (feels?) the same. We share a connection unlike any other I've ever felt with anyone. I truly believe she is my other half. She is my soul mate.. . Well, about 2 months ago, she broke up with me. She has a lot of mental problems and she moved back in with her parents because she felt like she formed an unhealthy dependency on me (she can't drive, etc) and wanted to find herself and be more independent. We still love each other at this point.. . A month and a half into this break up, we start spending more time together. And about a week ago, she says that we're back together. Obviously, I'm estatic. I love this girl with all of my heart and soul. I would die for her.. . She's schizophrenic and is in therapy and is really trying to figure her shit out, and I'm proud of her for it.. . Tonight, she called me over, and broke up with me. Again. Said that she was too happy with me and rushed into something before she sorted out all her mental problems. We talked for like, 2 hours at her house. We both still love each other, and we never argued or had any issues during the time we were together, and that's what makes this so hard. Our relationship was so unique and special. Never fought, never argued, never had any trust isseues because of social media or cell phones. I've never been with anyone like her.. . So tonight, she told me that there was a guy that she met like 2 days ago and she was terrified because she was attracted to him. That's why she broke up with me. Because it's not fair to me.. . And then, after talking to her about it for 2 hours, we agree on taking a vacation together because we both need to get out of this god forsaken state and away from our toxic families.. . I'm just so confused. I'm suicidal. I'm devastated. I'm desperate. I love this girl so much. I share something with her that no one else could ever even come close to. I resigned myself from love, because anyone I'm with in the future won't come close. I'll never get over her. I'll only be thinking of her.. . But she's sending me mixed signals. I feel like she's toying with me, even though I know she isn't, because she's always been open and honest with me. She's just confused and doesn't know what she wants.. . But fuck, I'm hurting. It's so hard to even function without her. I was overcome with so much anxiety and depression from the initial break up in June that I had to quit my fucking job because I would go in and have a goddamn panic attack every day.. . And now, I'm stressing out because I can't find a new job. Shit sucks. And since she broke up with me again, TONIGHT, I don't know what to feel. I want to self harm, but I'm not going to. It's just so hard. I can't imagine a life without her and my emotions are just all over the place. I go from hating her to loving her to hating her again. I don't know what to do or feel. I'm so confused and I just... fuck... . I can't even put it into words. I'm just in such a shitty place.. . The love of my life left me not once, but twice, I quit my job because I'm a big fucking baby and can't handle reality, my car payment is stacking up and my parents are bugging me about it because the bank is getting pissed about my loan. I'm in rock fucking bottom. I have no professional skills whatsoever to my name. All I've ever worked is retail and food service, and its fuckign awful. I only have a High School education, so I can't apply anywhere that actually pays worth a shit.. . I'm 22 and I'm unemployed, stuck with bills I can't pay, living in my mothers basement, depressed and suicidal because my other half decided she doesn't want me anymore, but at the same time, she does.

"Whenever I get a package of plain M&amp;Ms, I make it my duty to continue the strength and robustness of the candy as a species. To this end, I hold M&amp;M duels Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the “loser,” and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round. I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&amp;Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&amp;Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world. Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment. When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&amp;M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&amp;M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3×5 card reading, “Please use this M&amp;M for breeding purposes.” This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M&amp;Ms. I consider this “grant money.” I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament.

At first she found this guy who was ""living overseas"" and wanted to meet her. They communicated by text and rarely ever spoke on the phone. Then all of a sudden, she told me that she was gonna send him $500 for his flight to the U.S. At that moment I told her that he was obviously scamming her just to get her money. But she went ahead and sent it away and said that he would pay it back to her double.. So she waited and waited all month during the holidays last year and never arrived. He kept making stuff up that he couldn't make it to meet my mom. But she still believed this frickin guy and kept exchanging texts with him. That's the time we really hit rock bottom and was about to be evicted from our apartment. That loss of $500 really affected us. We got evicted and now live in a small room for rent.. About the first months of 2017 she had tried to keep up with the bills after losing that $500 but couldn't that's why were no longer in our apartment.. . And now recently this month, she went back again on one of those dating sites then found some guy who was in the army and wanted to meet him.. Now again this guy was asking $300 from her now. . This was over the weekend recently, I tried everything to stop her but she still didn't want to face the facts that all these guys that she's been talking to are just scamming her out of her money. So she went ahead and sent it now.. That's where I got into an argument with her back and forth. I said that I would leave her and live with my grandparents instead if she keeps doing this. . Then she freaked out and through a tantrum how her life is miserable and wanted to kill herself if I leave her.. I just don't know what to do anymore with her and would be willing to leave her.

"Here for the cupcakes.Ok, I lied. I am just another person who is suicidal.. . Because of the flow of events in my life, I have never connected much at all with any of my peers. My family is, and was, very very much fundamentalist christian. I took passionately to the faith; this conflicted with a growing realization that I was only attracted to other guys. My family moved on average every year until recently. A ""friend"" in my mind has come to mean somebody I feel safe talking to at all. In grade school I got very good grades and was in the gifted program. I have pretty awesome SAT scores and am a black-belt (in tang soo do). I hate myself. Being my mother's emotional support and punching bag since my father left when I was a freshman in high-school has made me deeply fearful of connecting with anyone to even the slightest degree. I have told, since I was 10, the people around me that I was deeply sad. After my father left my mother finally took me seriously enough to let me see somebody about it. Depression meds made it difficult for me to think or feel anything at all. I started cutting soon after starting on the meds. I took myself off of them and stopped cutting after about a month after the meds started to have an effect. I haven't ever told anybody about the cutting. Who wouldn't feel ashamed of not being able to deal with what so many other people clearly are dealing with just fine? I talked to several councilors but it always ended in them thinking I was just fine because I couldn't tell them anything that really mattered without also telling them that I had a strong urge, though not desire, to end my life. I have fallen completely behind in college, and I will most certainly fail my entire second semester, after getting full A's in the first semester. In a very painfully deep way, I don't know how to handle knowing that I will wake up tomorrow. On the drive to and from school I have found myself making very very stupid mistakes and also found it very difficult to resist driving off a bridge which is close to my house every time I pass it. (the speed limit there is unreasonably high for the back road it is) I just want to make sure there isn't something super obvious that I am missing that everybody else is somehow just understanding.. . I would be very appreciative if the things below did not show up in the comments:. . 1) anything with the word ""wait"" or ""it gets better"" in it  . 2) anything about being there for somebody  . (In the metaphorical sense, it is a kind gesture but not honestly helpful; if I had somebody there for me irl I wouldn't be posting this right now.). .

"I may have posted here before. I don’t recall, then again I don’t really care. I am going to kill myself in the next two years most likely. I just want to explain the reasons why.I am twenty years old. First off, let me say that I have cerebral palsy—I was cursed at birth. I had just enough damage done to affect my motor skills and walking in a significant way, but not to take my mind as well. I would have rather been retarded, because a functioning mind has helped me to realize the incredibly bleak reality for disabled people in the world, especially in the world of job prospects and dating (tho I have made up my mind to live life as a bachelor, so I don’t have to make a total fool of myself trying to get a girlfriend or spouse; so that part is less bothersome to me) . . In addition, my disability has robbed me of many things I would’ve loved to do the foremost of which would’ve been playing an instrument and painting; I have always been appreciative of the arts, particularly music but my lack of motor skills mean both of these pursuits are totally unavailable to me. I have tried prose &amp; poetry and though others have praised my work in this regard it’s shit and I know what they are doing, I know others take pity on me and try their best to ‘help’ me in any way they can. They mean well of course, but I know their evaluations of my work (which is again, shit) are based partly on my visible disability.  My suicide will be my act of rebellion against the universe, where most people learn to ‘make peace’ with their disability I refuse to. I will not make compromise with something that has already stunted my progress in so many ways. . . In the last two or so years, I have also developed significant  tinnitus in both ears after having it at a level I could barely register for the entirety of my life that I can remember. This has led to difficulty with sleeping, increased noise sensitivity and an inability to enjoy music in the same was as before the increase in ringing, as well as the general feeling of despair which comes with a noise that never quiets. ENTs and such have done their best but they are as confused as I and so I have one option left. . . The last reason is that I simply don’t like the direction of the world. The Chinese (government) have increasing power over international affairs, including in countries like mine; the United States, and there’s no stopping their rise. We, and many other Western nations are nothing but thralls who reprimand China once in a while, too attached by trade deals and globalization to do anything significant. With climate change speeding on, and a world in which American popular culture is slowly making everyone into a global monoculture (the beginnings of which we can already see), this world adheres to values that I find repugnant and thus I wish to have no part in it. End rant. I have many friends &amp; a family that love me very much, but if they know me they’ll understand my decision. They may never agree, and I couldn’t care less, I only hope they understand.",suicide

"Holy fucking shit I hate myselfI always try to get drunk because I think it will make my thoughts more erratic and random, but really it just isolates the thoughts of self-loathing. I probably do this sub-consciously because if I focus on the reasons that I hate myself I will be more likely to kill myself focusing on only the negative things about me. (Obviously) I am going to ignore the “positive” things about me and only focus on the things that make me want to remove myself from this world. I say “this world”, but really we only get one life. I don’t want to start over, because there is no starting over. We get what we get, but I think that I’m too weak and pathetic a person to improve for the better. 5’11” (and a half that I sometimes round to 6’ to make myself feel better) and sometimes 160 pounds. I fluctuate between 155-160 but usually I’m below. That’s skinny as fucking shit. Basically skin and bone. I look at my wrists and I fucking recoil in disgust because I can see my individual wrist bones. Along with that, I am either extremely shy or don’t like people. Either way, I wish that I would interact with others more. What I “want” and what I “wish I wanted” are two different things. This is an incoherent mess, because (what I think is) luckily, I’m drunk. But when I’m drunk, I just spill my mind’s thoughts. This is kind of good, but kind of bad. I can’t talk like this while sober. This’ll be the end of this post because I have to piss. If someone tells me I’m not that bad, I won’t believe them. If someone tells me I’m a good guy, I won’t believe them. Just ignore me, because this post isn’t inherently suicidal. Yeah, I am suicidal, but this post isn’t saying that I’ll shoot myself in the head or choke for a couple minutes by hanging myself. If I banged myself, I would make sure that it snapped my neck instantly. I’m a (former state, wow, I’ve fallen pretty far) swimmer, so I know how scary the feeling of suffocating is. If I am going to kill myself, I’ll make it instant. Either jumping off a cliff, shooting my self, or having enough height while hanging myself to instantly snap my neck. That’s my (slightly or not, idk) drunk post. Respond if you want, I don’t care (I only say that to reinforce the “I’m a tough 17 year old” ego that I’ve adopted). Peace out, I probably won’t kill my self tonight, so maybe this post will be deleted. If you’re reading this, you should probably better invest your time with someone who has a rope around their neck, or a gun pointed to their head right now. May the world have peace, Patrick H.

"I feel like I’m overdue for my deathIm writing this at 5am because I can’t sleep with all these thoughts in my head. I’m 14 and I have always had depression. My mom has paranoia and I think I have it too, along with my dads depression. My whole life I’ve been depressed and I don’t remember a single time in my life where I was genuinely happy for more than a day. . . I just recently got out of a “toxic” relationship. He made me feel like a problem and every time I told him something negative about myself he would just tell me I was right and I need to fix it or he’ll leave me. We were dating for almost a year and when we broke up he was threatening me, saying that because I hurt him that he would get his brothers to come “fuck me up”. He still calls me a bitch on a daily basis. It’s been a little over a month since we broke up and I’ve tried to move on. There’s even a guy I like and he said he likes me back but I’ve had the feeling that I can’t trust him and I have no idea why.. . I also have a serious problem with alcohol. I’ve been trying to get help with it but everyone passes it off as nothing. I’ve talked to three different therapists about it and they just tell my parents to lock it up. Not a single therapist I’ve talked to has ever tried to help me. They just take things away and don’t fix the mental part of the problem.. . When I was in 5th to 7th grade I had to deal with my 20 year old sister. Every time I came home she would start yelling at me and she would blame me for things I had no correlation with. She’s tried to kill me many times. I remember all the times where I had to run to my room and keep the door shut as long as possible because she would try to knock it down and stab me. She moved out last summer but I still have ptsd from that. The whole time I had to go trough that, nobody would listen to me and they would call me a liar.. . I’ve been having nonstop suicidal thoughts for a couple weeks now and I have an intention to follow through with it. I’ve tried talking to as many therapists as possible but all they tell me is “that’s too bad, wish I could help”. I really feel hopeless and I feel like I’m slowly loosing my mind. . . Yesterday I got my phone taken away during school and it sent me into the worst panic attack in my life. All my friends saw me and nobody will talk to me anymore. everyone thought I was crying over my phone. It wasn’t for that reason at all. I don’t know why it happened but I was scared of my mom that she would take away my phone for a week or longer and on top of that, when I’m feeling suicidal I scroll through reddit and listen to music and it helps me talk myself out of it.. . My mom made me talk to another therapist once she picked me up from school early. I ended up telling them about the pills I have stashed under my bed and about the whiskey I drink every other day whenever I need to relax. My mom took everything away from me and I can’t go back to school after what happened. I feel really stuck and I don’t want to be weak. I’ve been through worse things and I survived. I’ve never asked for help before because I believe in fixing your own problems yourself but I really need help. I feel so tired and I just want to end it all so I can finally calm down and relax. I’m tired of these constant threats of my sister moving back in, or people at my school trying to beat the shit out of me, and my mom taking away everything I own. I know things aren’t going to get better because I seriously can’t get rid of my depression. I really need help and I can’t go on.",suicide

"So this is my plan for tonightMy mother just left to my aunt with her boyfriend, so I have the whole night before anyone comes. Right now I can drink my tea in peace, then finish the letter for my best friend and make some more recordings as she wanted, because I speak better than I write.... . . . Then I should check my belongings and write notes so that people know what to do with them. Give a part to my best friend, some other stuff to burn and the rest to donate.. . . . I should copy all the stuff my mother needs from my computer since I promised my best friend she'll have it and because I need her to send some post-mortem messages. It might be an ugly way of letting people know I died, but talking with them before will only make them feel guilty afterwards. So I have to write them some letters too, and especially to mom.. . . . Then I'll make myself a coffee and finish the cigarettes I kept for this evening while watching the snow in the cold night, listening to my favourite tunes. . . . . Then take a shower, change clothes, meditate, and die, quick enough to avoid thinking of my only regret, and that is the pain I'll cause to the people around me. . . . .

Every time I see a high building i'm just like ""damn.. wish my skull would crack when I hit the ground from jumping"", but I have a fear of heights and i'm just a pathetic little coward in general, so this plan backfires quite often.

I'm like a safeguard for them, they come running to me when they're scared and I don't want them to have no one to protect them anymore. I also hate knowing that they'd be scratching on my door to come in and the door doesn't open because no one is there. I'm just gone and they don't see me again. I don't want them to be alone or upset. They're both 9 years old, so I have no long it is until they go.

"Thinking about everything I want to put in a noteA little over 3 weeks ago, I made a half assed attempt, after my best(and only) friend of 10 years told me she was “over it after my birthday passed and you said nothing”. I said nothing because she left town last minute with no warning, and I had a card to give her in person. Anyway, in the weeks since, I’ve gotten over that. If you can end things like that, you were never the friend I thought you were. I was able to talk the hospital into letting me go home after a couple days. I had been committed against my will. Our mental health department was supposed to call within a few days to get outpatient treatment going. I’ve been depressed for several years, coupled with severe anxiety. Medical problem after medical problem, with seizures starting the week before the attempt. Which was I think likely just another trigger. Anyways, my family doctor has been on sick leave for months now, and over 3 weeks has passed with mental health not contacting me. I’ve stopped self medicating. I haven’t had a drink or any weed since before the ambulance showed up.(Downing pills directly in front of my husband wasn’t the best choice to go with, but I was drunk and just beyond having any hope that night). . Anyways, if you’ve gotten this far. I just, feel completely alone. My husband is gone for work 730am-6pm, at minimum. I have no friends. No one to talk to. And the thoughts just became way too much again last night. I’m trying to rationalize that I do love him, and I don’t want him to have to live with the images of coming home to find me. And I don’t really want to leave my dogs, or my pig. But I’ve spent the last 24 hours coming up with a mental list of actual effective ways to get the job done. I’m writing this here in the hopes it convinces me not to write the note I’ve been thinking about. I cried myself to sleep thinking about the things I want to say. I just. I don’t want to do this anymore. I can’t leave the house alone anymore because of the seizures. We had to take insurance off my car because I’m legally not allowed to drive now. I’m just, stuck. Even more than I had been before. My days are empty. ",suicide

"Normal conversation Me: reading in my room. Dad: Comes in. Dad: so.  What did ya get on ur biology test yesterday?. Me: I got a 22/25 on that test . Dad: what the fuck. That’s so fucking low.  What the fuck is ur problem?. Me: I don’t know what my problem is and so I emailed the teacher-. Dad: like what the fuck is ur problem.  You said to me a couple of days ago you understand everything about that topic and you get low of a fucking score?. Me: no I thought I knew everything but it looks like I didn’t and so I emailed the teacher-. Dad: no fucking excuses.  And that’s ur fucking problem. You don’t know your problem. What the fuck is with you?. Me: yeah I don’t know my problem so I asked the teacher if-. Dad- I don’t give a shit.  You told me u knew everything and that you were confident you were going to do good at the test. And what do you do?  You fail the fucking test! Below average even. Me: the class average is-. Dad: I don’t give a fuck what it is it’s low still. I don’t know why you think you know everything. Me: I never said I knew everything. Dad: then why did you say you knew everything a couple of days ago huh?. Me: I said I knew everything about that test and what to do to prepare for it and I did it.. Dad: but you failed the test right?. Me: no I didn’t fail the test, I just-. Dad: don’t you try to be smart with me.  You got questions wrong right?. Me: yes. Dad: so you didn’t know everything did you?. Me: I THOUGHT I did but I guess I didn’t know all there is to the test. Dad: so you lied to me then huh. Me: no. Dad: you said to me you knew everything and now u just admitted you didn’t and so you lied. RIGHT!?!?!!?. Me: I guess.... Dad: now that’s ur fucking problem. You lie and you don’t know your problem. Ur fucking grounded until I see improvement . . A day later. . Me: so apparently the questions I got wrong were actually right, the google form test just didn’t accept the answer. So my real grade for the test is 25/25 and not 22/25. Dad: good. So ur grade for that test is now perfect right?. Me: yes. And it wasn’t my fault when it said it was a 22/25 . Dad: what. Me; yeah. It wasn’t my fault that it said it was a 22/25 when we talked yesterday . Dad: what do you mean it’s not your fault.  . Me: it’s not my fault because the google form test just didn’t accept the answer. Dad: didn’t accept the answer? So you got it wrong?. Me: no, I got it correct bu-. Dad: then why doesn’t it accept the answer?  It doesn’t make any sense you’re not making any sense right now.  . Me: I’m saying the technology fault not my fault. . Dad: and there you go blaming everything else for your problems. Me: no I was jus-. Dad: that’s another one of your fucking problems. Blaming everybody else. Just once just fucking admit your mistake. Me: it wasn’t my mistake it was the technology that made the mistake. Dad: can you just say I admit I made a mistake. Me: fine. I made a mistake and it’s my fault . Dad: now that wasn’t so hard was it. Next time, don’t go fucking blaming everything else for your mistakes you fucking understand me?. Me: yes. Dad: good. . . . I’m so fucking tired of dealing with this shit like what the fuck are you listening to me. . . Tldr: I get a 22/25 on a biology test and dads not happy. He says my problems are lying and and not knowing what my problems are even though I emailed the teacher to ask what I got wrong and keeps interrupting me. Turns out it was a google form error and then my dad says I blame everything on something else and never admit to something and makes me say I admit my mistake",non-suicide

"I want to die more than everMy mind is out of control. I feel utterly and completely trapped in it and cut off from the outside world, even when I'm out amongst it. I look in the mirror and I wonder why the pain doesn't show. I constantly think of my ex and how she moved on so quick and slept with three people within weeks of us breaking up after a five year relationship. I was a terrible boyfriend. I honestly tried but I cheated. I couldn't contain my emotions. Then I moved away to get sober and get better for our son and she started soaring when I was gone. I'm a drain on everyone I get close to and it is so hard for me to get close to anyone. I cant leave my bed now. I lost my job. I was clean 4 months but our relationship deteriorating has wrecked me. I constantly want to die. All day I went hiking with my dad and his gf and all I could think the whole time is should I get a gun or a rope. I'm too scared to even kill myself though. I went to the hospital two times and they kicked me out and referred me to outpatient. I reached out to family and they offered supporting words but nothing else. I'm a 26 year old man baby. I was diagnosed bipolar 2 and generalized anxiety with a substance abuse disorder. I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired. I did everything right, I did the meds, the excercise, the dieting, journaling, meditation, and i still lost everything. I cant even be a good father.

"A piece of my personality and my soul dies a little everydayI was on venlafaxine and was fine on it for years doing great had a fantastic life and then I came off it very slowly from jan to june this year and then from sept onwards my anxiety has only worsened every day is a battle to stay alive to fight dark horrible Intrusive thoughts and urges to not harm myself to remember who I am even.. I was taking sertraline to begin with and I didn’t give it enough time to work. Thought ok I’ll go back on venlafaxine cause it worked before but it really isn’t working to me.

Valium Seroquel zimovane propranolol and I barely make it through a day without trying to harm or kill myself. I have no quality of life I go nowhere I mostly just hide under my duvet from everyone cause I’m scared I will hurt them. I am get  agitated through most of the day v forgetful and get quite confused. I don’t even say the same things I used to anymore I don’t speak with any confidence or clearly. I can’t even bare to look in the mirror and I have a wall of mirrors on wardrobe doors so I have to open one and so I don’t see myself.

The Seroquel is horrible the feeling is too intense and I don’t like it at all but I don’t know what else to do aside from the obvious. I’m trapped in this house so I can’t run and kill myself if I jump out the window I likely won’t die and I’ve tried hanging numerous times but the sensation and the pain in my neck and throat is too much for me to bare. I’m literally trapped in my mind my home and in this life I have a family a daughter that I barely go near cause I’m scared to be around her my partner irritates me as soon as he opens his mouth.

"Need help, asking a friend out So, I was introduced to her by a friend a couple months back. But we didn't talk much then. For the last month, we've been really hitting it off on text and call mostly (we only met 3 times yet cause of the pandemic). Initially, I was thinking that I wasn't ready to be in a real relationship because my last one had me questioning if I was good enough to be boyfriend material.. . But with her, I feel like I want to ask her out so bad but she knows about how I didn't want to be in a relationship and she totally respected that. In fact, when we talked a lot and I was getting those obvious signals that she likes me as well, I had a conversation with her about this and she said that we should stay like we are, because it's great for her and see where it goes next. . . Now, I'm in a place where I think I really want to ask her out but I don't want to do it normally like when we meet. I wanna do something special when I ask her out, can anyone help me with ideas? Also, I'm financially okay, but not that great to give some sort of grand gesture so, if those could be avoided in the advice, I'd be really grateful!",non-suicide
"The SituationThe time came about 25 hours ago now. While sitting around with friends I decided to do it and abruptly left to head home. I stopped to get my last cigarette and my last pint of whiskey and continued on my way. I seemed to be in the house alone, so I wrote out a note on a memo pad in the kitchen and hung it from the string that controls the ceiling fan. It simply read . . &gt; I LOVE YOU. . . &gt; Don't look. Call 911.. . . I went down to my bedroom and brought up the last song I would ever listen to. I lit my last cigarette and started swigging from my last pint. I grabbed my Ruger, in which I had been keeping a single FMJ in the chamber, because I would like to at least give my family an open casket. I would aim for the top of my brain stem. Halfway through the last song I would ever hear, I heard someone screaming for me, and then a banging on my door. It turned out someone was home. And I'm still here. But I think it's a matter of time before it happens again, a month at the most. And this time I'll be more careful. My guns were taken, which I wasn't supposed to have anyway, so next time I'll stop by the department store to grab a hose and some duct tape. I'll find a secluded spot on the outskirts of town and direct my cars exhaust through a window which I'll seal with the tape. I'll smoke my last few cigarettes and swig from my last point, and that will be that.. . I'll probably be found before my corpse is too far gone for an open casket to be an option. No more me. Forever. It's a strange thought to think, but it's an even stranger feeling to get used to thinking it.",suicide
"What's the point in even trying?Maybe I should motivate myself. Maybe I should try and make myself happy. Maybe I should do everything it takes to make my life ""worth living"" but what's the point? I'm comfortable where I'm at now and even when I do achieve happiness it's not like my life would be anymore valuable than those who haven't. I'm still going to die, and I'm still going to be forgotten just like everyone else. So why shouldn't I just kill myself? Why should I bother others with my bitching and moaning about how difficult life is, potentially becoming one of the problems they have to overcome? In the end I wont change. I'll never push myself to become better because I see no real reason why, even if there is one staring me right in the face. If I keep on living I'll just become a sad, unmotivated, sack of shit that everyone will eventually everyone will give up on. I know my own problem, but I'm too stubborn and hopeless to fix myself. Why not just skip to the end and die alone, disappointing  everyone I leave behind? Why should I deal with this any longer? ",suicide
"Failed semester, Got forgiven, Got sober (8 mos.), Went back to school, Failing again.About 9 months ago I had a mental breakdown and begin drinking like crazy, which resulted in failing my classes for the semester.

My school's counseling program was amazing and had me tell my family what was going on;  I got sober, enrolled in a PHP program, turned my life around, got the classes removed from my transcript, and went back to school this Fall.  . . Now, I am sucking at my classes again.  I got A+'s on my midterms, and I love what I am studying, but I have been sleeping in and missing the last several classes, and missed two big papers.  I think some people are just incompetent and rotten to their core, and can't be fixed.  . . I was unbelievably lucky to get the second chance that I got, and I've thrown it all away.

"I keep thinking of jumping off a buildingIt’s been consistently weeks of running off to my apartment’s rooftop, and bawling my eyes out until I feel numb. And the cycle continues. . . I moved to another country alone. Had some not so close friends and eventually met the love of my life. During that time, i was amazed at how Love paved way for me to make grand plans: career, vacations, etc.,. . The main reason I was so driven to turn my career around and learn my love’s language as well as getting another degree is because I’m not European. I’m Asian. I can’t easily get into the job market. But even if it was hard, he became my rock. . . As I’m a foreigner, his family did not like me. And that pushed me more to integrate, learn their culture and language, and be accepted for who I am.. . However, my love’s insecurities and anxieties  worsened, and he decided to deal with it on his own. . . So I was left alone.. . I don’t have family or close friends who understand me in this country. So for the first time, I felt like a mess. I lost all my plans and focus. . . . It’s beeen more than a month already. And during these dark times, I started seeing a therapist, even tried dating other people, going to the gym, partying but it still ends up the same.  I realized that I am not capable of loving other people. I thought it would make me feel better but it didn’t. I still crawl back at the end of the day in my bed, crying every single day.. . . I feel guilty that my love / best friend has to see all of it and feel bad about it. I thought having him around would make me feel better because that’s what I wanted: I didn’t want him to leave. But the more I see him, the more painful it gets.. . . The other week, he ended up holding me down as he found me sitting on the ledge.  I don’t know what I want anymore other than to feel peaceful . When he tried to hold me down, I kept telling him to go and screaming “why can’t I do what I want and you could?”. . I would end up crying hard about it badly. I wish I could just move on and forget he ever existed. I wish I will no longer be a burden.. . But ever since he walked away, I no longer know what I am here for. My happiness and sense of purpose doesn’t rely on him.. . On some days, I think of going home to my family. But home no longer feels home.

"Suicidal 13 year oldI don’t want to talk about what’s going on because every-time I do on here people always say the same thing to me,. . “You’re too young to have depression”. “You’re too young to kill your self”. “You haven’t even experienced life yet”. “Why would you cut yourself it solves nothing”. . And then the odd one out. “Cut deeper next time”. . So as you can see this already gives you some details about me. I’m 13, I’m a female, I self harm and I started a couple weeks ago. That’s something EVERYONE pays attention too. So I’ll make it clear. . I SELF HARM. I CUT MY ARMS (Not my wrists). IM AWARE IT “DOESNT HELP”. . I am aware that these thoughts seem silly or stupid to people because of my age but truthful I’m someone who tends to act more mature then the people around me. For gods sake I’m mistaken as someone in college. I am fully aware about my depression and disorders even if not properly diagnosed. I’m aware that I probably should get help but it really isn’t easy when you have been referring to suicide since the last time you can even (actually) remember. I also know that my body could be scarred because of what I’m doing. One thing I’ll note on my self harm is I use scissors, it’s not easy for me to get a razor blade and with scissors it’s all instant. I press down with the edge of the scissors on my arm and I drag them quickly across my arm while my arm goes the opposite direction. I wanted to say that because people seem to think I’m using razors and that that’s an option for me to kill myself (it’s a lot harder to do that with scissors you stole from school) . . I also believe that I’ve been getting social anxiety and I tend to be really quiet in groups then I was before everything happened, but because of this I’m craving attention because I’m not getting any for days on end sometimes. I even lost the people closest to me because of my lack of sympathy and emotion towards others(its been happening after I went through something really emotion that destroyed me so I started to act distant and even stopped showing emotions for a good while). I also sometimes tend to lash out because I keep every emotion inside of me and I can feel it in my chest and I can feel myself holding in tears, I even almost cried while getting a ride home from someone.. . Mentally I’m not ok, at all and i know I’m just quickly posting this so no one will care, that’s obvious but I might as well try.. . One thing about my family I would like to note is that my actual dad was abusive, I was really young when he left (4-6) and so I never really experienced it BUT I have a step dad who acts like a child, and if I’m having an absolutely horrible day he will pester me and if I say anything back to me he gets his “big boy pants on” and borderline threatens me with my games (which is all I play because I genuinely don’t have a life) he will sit here and annoy me but if I just want to talk for a few seconds he shoo’s me off and gets mad at me. IM NOT EVEN ALOUD TO EXPRESS EMOTIONS IM LITERALLY STUCK ALL DAY LONG NEVER BEING ABLE TO CRY AND THEY GET MAD AT ME BECAUSE IM BREAKING AND CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE.. . Even writing this right now is hard not to cry and I’m aware that I’m probably going to get in trouble some how before I finish getting all my thoughts out there. . . I’m going to wrap this up quickly with what’s probably going to happen tomorrow.. . Tomorrow at 2 pm (EDT) I plan to come home from school put my things down and walk to the beach which is only a few minutes away. I’ll say my goodbyes to the people who were close to me and apologize for them not liking me anymore. After that I’ll go into the ocean just to drown myself because if I can’t swim I can’t chicken out. I’ll be stuck suffering and dying slowly. .

Drowning myself is going to be interesting and well I hope it’s at least an interesting experience if I don’t chicken out.",suicide

"I tried hanging myself this morning.I woke up from a nightmare about a friend of mine, I woke up crying and my heart beating extremely fast.

"I don't think I can commit to it but I am constantly thinking about itSo ever since I started college I began falling behind in pretty much all aspects of my life. I wasn't making any friends and I was doing poorly in all my classes (never formed a study habit). It continued for a year or two and I was hiding my grades from my parents. It got bad enough that I eventually had to tell them and I medically withdrew and transferred closer to home. I thought a fresh start could help and not having the burden of those lies would allow me to get on track. Now I'm another year in and I'm doing it again. I don't want to kill myself but I do feel that dying wouldn't be too bad. I know that school and all that isn't anything to kill yourself over and it isn't the end of the world but I have no motivation. I want to make something creative, I have videos that need editing, ideas that I want to flesh out, etc. but I just am either too lazy or unmotivated to do any of them. I'm starting to give up on college and know that the only way for me to be successful is to focus on these creative endeavors and make something out of it. I just can't start working on them and I don't know why. I just fall back onto playing video games instead, even though I'm not even having much fun playing them. I enjoyed writing at /r/writingprompts on down time at my last internship but I've completely stopped doing that too. I feel like everyone around me is moving on to bigger and better things and I'm just in this inescapable rut that I've created for myself. Anyways It's ok if no one reads this or responds I just kind of wanted to write it all out but in case anyone did read through the whole thing, thanks.",suicide
"One of my high school teachers passed away.  I got a text from one of my friends back in high school that he passed away in his sleep from a heart attack. He was 61 years old and apparantly his daughter was set to marry that weekend. I don't know why but it hit me so hard. I've been in college for 1,5 years now but I cried when I saw it.. . He was such a wonderful man, he was our physics teacher but meant so much more to us students than I can even imagine. He was a kind man, always taught his course with so much passion and hilarity even when we were bored. He was so invested in our school's activities, he sang in the school choir, participated in school plays and accompanied us and entertained us on school trips. On one of my last days of high school, he even told us about how he had stood on the roof of our building to help a depressed student from jumping off. I didn't know how much I appreciated him as a teacher until now, and I feel like shit.. . The day after I heard he died, I had to go to college and do a presentation and I fucked it because I started crying in the middle of it. I had to get this off my chest and want to let people know how great of a man he was. Thank you all for listening, and because this is r/teenagers I wanted to remind you high school kids know that if you have any teachers that mean something to you, tell them.

"Does anyone here get sudden urges to kill yourself despite being otherwise (somewhat) happy?I've been in a better mood for the past few months (in general). But sometimes, especially at night when I'm alone, I just start to...idk how to describe it, break down? I start involuntarily breathing heavily and freaking out, then I start to disassociate. This is usually accompanied by strong suicidal thoughts and urges. I don't self harm all that bad. I have a rusty box cutter in my room that I lost. I dont ever make myself bleed, just usually scratch my stomach and left arm. It doesnt really leave any permanent marks, maybe it looks a little red for the next few days. Kinda like if a dog scratched me. I havent been doing that here lately, I lost that box knife and am too much of a pussy to use scissors.. . I fantasize about suicide often. About if people would care, what I would put in my note, etc etc. My earliest suicidal thought was in 3rd grade. I don't know WHY. I had no idea what depression was, much less suicide. I just spent that whole day wishing I was dead and wanting to hurt myself. I just finished 9th grade, and it still happens now. . . My dad confronted me in 6th grade by accusing me of being ""goth to be cool,"" despite me never even being goth or emo or whatever, other than my music taste at the time (Fall Out Boy, Panic at the Disco, you get the idea. Bands with a large emo/goth fanbase). I told my mom in 7th grade (2017-18) after I had come close to actually killing myself quite a few times. It took her until February this year to reluctantly promise me a therapy session. I had another one of my breakdowns the night after my birthday celebration, which was actually an awesome day. It took until March for her to book it, it was rescheduled for June due to coronavirus. I'm not angry with my mom for this, I love her to death. I understand why she was reluctant but we're pass that. . . Anyways, even when I don't have one of my breakdowns, I still get the urge to kill myself often. Like I'll be driving to the store with my mom, while I'm in the passenger seat fantasizing about my death. At the same time, the thought of my mortality is fucking scary. I panic about that sometimes, too. I don't want to be DEAD, exactly, I just wish I was...gone. Or didn't exist. . . Along with all of this, I hate my body. No offense to any women here but I hate the fact that I was born as a woman. I hate my boobs and I hate my vagina, I hate my high pitched voice, and I hate the shape of my face. I hate the fact that my face is too fat so I have to keep my hair shoulder length. Think like, idk, about as long as Eddie Vedder from the 90s or Kurt Cobain. I don't understand why, but I do. I hate talking about this because I'm afraid I come off as sexist. I have no intentions of this and I'm sorry if I offended anyone.. . I feel so guilty all of the time. I apologize to my mom all the time even if I didn't do anything. I'll ask if I did something wrong if she's doing something out of the ordinary. I bet she probably gets annoyed. If any of my friends are even slightly upset about something, I'm always worried I did something to hurt them. . . I'm sorry if this post went on too long, I didnt intend for it to be.

"My suicidal desires are putting so much weight on my boyfriend.Sorry if I'm not doing something right, this is my first actual post on Reddit. He's the person who introduced me to this. Also, my storytelling is not the best.. . We are both 19 years old and have been together for more than 2 years. For the majority of the relationship, I have been depressed and would always vent to him. About 6 months into our relationship, I lost faith in the religion I grew up with and since it was my life, I ended up losing myself completely. That's where it started. The religion thing is a whole nother story though.. Since then, my boyfriend would always hear a mouthful from me about how I'm not the same, and these suicidal thoughts kept on coming up. Mind you though, I've had suicidal thoughts since I was still religious, and a while before we started dating. I never loved myself. I still don't. I hate myself more now than ever. But this was just when it started escalating. 1 and a half years later, he's way past fed up. I can't blame him. My happiness worn out, but whenever I was sad or angry, it felt more powerful. Pain felt more painful. When he got me angry, my reactions got worse and worse. Our relationship wasn't the same after what happened, and started spiraling down. There have been times where we considered breaking up, but we never did. We took a couple of breaks, but we always gave up and talked to each other after just a whole day of no communication. . He honestly doesn't deserve to be tortured by staying with me because of all the damage I have caused him. I have made him cry a bunch of times, and he doesn't even cry like that. I have hurt him a lot. Recently I fucked up big time, and he's thinking about whether or not to break this relationship off. His final answer will be given on Tuesday.. . I can't blame him for being fed up with me not getting help or taking my meds. He's just the one person who would always listen to me. The ONE person I could actually trust fully. He was always there for me when I had my emotional episodes. If he had tons of college work and I was hurting, he would stop working and talk to me. He got so mad when he saw the bruises I put on my face from hitting myself so much. The only reason why I don't cut is because I want to try modeling. Ridiculous reason, I know. So I just (literally) beat myself up instead when need be. Bruises heal.. . But he hates how I haven't helped myself enough to get better. He is the only person who was there for me EVERY time my suicidal desires came up. And that happened a lot. He threatened to call 911 when I was prepping for hanging myself. No one ever went that far for me, y'know? . . Imagine having to hear your s/o go on about how s/he wants to kill herself (or himself), every day for more than a year and a half. I don't know how he does it. I'm sure anyone would be fed up. Any normal person would leave. . . I was looking at similar posts earlier, from guys with suicidal girlfriends. A lot of the replies were suggesting they leave their girlfriends so they don't get emotionally drained too. I get that, but...it does suck to see that, being the suicidal girlfriend.... . I was thinking that if he decides not to break it off this Tuesday, I'll just do it for him. I told him recently that I wanted to set him free. I feel like I'm weighing him down, and I don't want him to suffer from someone else's pain anymore. When I visit him on Tuesday, I'm going to give him gifts (late v-day presents) and bake him lots of cookies, followed by some meaningful conversation and cuddling...but then, I'm thinking of breaking it off, and either killing myself at some point eventually, or getting help and actually bettering myself. Either way, he is stuck in the cage. I want to set him free. I have taken so much joy away from him.. . I am living a life that is nothing like I wanted it to be. I wanted to be happy, and fulfill my number one goal of being successful in the music industry. Instead, I work retail, having to be social. Yay..

"I want to hear from some fellow suicidal people on alcoholism. I'm pretty sure I'm an alcoholic.I kind of use it as a coping mechanism. I drink a lot of nights. I don't get hammered or blacked out drunk or anything, I just drink until I don't feel like it anymore, which is usually around 5 drinks depending on the night I guess. The thing about my drinking, is, I know it's wrong, and my closest friends don't like it, but they won't ever speak up about it. But what they don't know is why I drink. I use it to stop feeling the way I do when I'm sober at night. I've been sober the last three nights, and it was the worst three night stretch I've had in a long time. I was extremely suicidal last night; I went for a drive, because that usually calms me down but it didn't feel right, and I started to have think about driving as fast as I could into a tree or something. So I turned back and went home. I tried to talk to my friend about it, the only friend who knows I'm suicidal, but that didn't go so well. Now we're not on great terms, once again. She hates that I drink for the reasons I do, but she won't ever help me even though I've asked numerous times. I know it's a bad habit and I've tried quitting once before, but I barely lasted one night. These last few nights (where I was just too lazy to go buy more alcohol) have made me scared to quit drinking because I know what'll happen if I do without a reliable alternate coping method. There are people I want to talk to, a couple I consider close friends, some not as much, but I like them a lot and trust them. I just don't feel like it would be right. To talk about my alcohol use would mean bringing up my suicidal past and tendencies, things I've only ever talked about with one friend, who I trust more than anyone.

"Antidepressant withdrawal is hardI don't need replies, I just need to vent. I could vent in notepad, but it feels different venting to a forum.. . I'm UK-based. I spent my full 3 years with Early Intervention in Psychosis. I get depressed, then I hear voices that want me to end my life. It took a bit of tinkering, but we found that escitalopram (an antidepressant) and no antipsychotic were good for me when I'm not in a depressive episode. . . A few months ago I found myself in a heavy depressive episode. I saw my GP to refer me back to the psychiatrist's office because I couldn't cope. I'd spent my full time with EIP, so I was referred to the community mental health team, who are less well funded. Psychiatrist #1 decided that escitalopram had stopped working for me, and organised a transfer to prozac. Also, because I was struggling with the voices he gave me the only antipsychotic I tried that didn't have horrible side effects - olanzapine. It's good for me when I'm depressed enough to hear voices, but not good for normal use because it slows my mental functions. I'm a PhD student in mathematics, I need to be as sharp as possible. . . I gave prozac a couple of months, but it didn't seem to start working. Wiki says that changing antidepressant because the old one stopped working has a 70% chance of working. So psychiatrist #2 (covering for psych #1) transferred me from prozac to mirtazapine. Prozac is supposed to be one of the easiest antidepressants to come off, but for me the high half-life meant that I had the side effects for longer. Epic mood swings downwards. Brain zaps like you wouldn't believe. Shakes. . . Mirtazapine was given a fair 6 weeks to start working, and it felt like I was taking sugar pills. I was so down that the wall that olanzapine put between me and the voices crumbled down. Worse, I was obeying them when they told me to hurt myself. I've punched myself in the head until bumps form, then hit myself some more. I've cut. Psych #2 was on holiday, so I saw psych #3. He transferred me from mirtazapine to sertraline. He wanted to up my olanzapine, but I pointed out that I already feel like there's too much cotton wool in my head, and I'm sleeping ~14 hours a night.. . This transfer is a cross taper. I take half dose of m and half dose of s for a week, then no m and full dose of s. Last night was my first night without m, and this morning was the first full dose of s. I'm getting withdrawal and I'm struggling to cope with the concept of carrying on until 1830 (when my partner returns from work), let alone a couple of weeks of withdrawl, and 4-6 weeks until s kicks in. If s kicks in. If s doesn't kick in then I'll have to struggle with yet another transfer. I've been transferring meds all year. I'm running out of struggle. . . The voices continue giving me hell while I struggle to do whatever coping strategies I can do. I have a barbell weight lifting routine I do, that I can't do right now because I don't have the energy. I can't read because there's too much depression and olanzapine slowing down my mental functions. I'm trying to listen to music, but instead I hear the voices enumerate the ways I could kill myself without leaving my flat. Also, I'm getting fatter because I'm struggling to motivate myself to track my calories, and my partner keeps bringing sweets home to try to cheer me up with sugar.. . Also, for bad timing, I had an appointment with a psychologist this week to see if a talking therapy would be useful. He said that CBT for psychosis would be useful, but the waiting list is 8-9 months. I'm struggling with the concept of being alive in 2 hours, let alone 5700 hours. . . I'm just taking things an hour at a time, at the moment. Taking things a day at a time it a bit too much to handle.",suicide

"Thoughts on suicideThoughts on suicide…. . So thinking on suicide, and it seems like it’d be harder to peacefully kill myself than I’d like.  Maybe it is because I know people who’ve tried and failed.. . My sister tried drinking everything under the sink and eating a bunch of pills (we didn’t have any fatal pills), all she managed to do was damage her liver and kidneys; she apparently would have needed to eat a lot more before she reached fatal liver damage.  She ended up vomiting a lot which countered her efforts as well.. . A family friend tried shooting himself, and now his head is very very messed up and he has quite a bit of brain damage.  Blew off a chunk of his face too.  Other friends found him.  They said they could still see him looking around immediately afterwards, it was quite horrific.. . Another friend tried cutting his wrists and while he bled to the point where he passed out, he didn’t die.. . I was trying to think about how I’d do it, and there aren’t a lot of good ways for me.  Ideally, I guess I’d like to take a couple bottles of sleeping pills and top it off with a bunch of alcohol, but I don’t know where to score prescription strength sleeping pills, I don’t have a doctor to lie to right now.  You can take boxes of over the counter sleeping pills without even approaching lethality.  Hell most of the stuff you can get over the counter even if you take a ton of it, it won’t kill you.  Same with most rat poisons.  _And_ even if you reach a lethal dose what you have to look forward to is liver failure, a week long and painful death.  So I don’t know how I’d go about doing that.. . I’ve gone to a gun store before, but felons can’t purchase guns.  They had all these signs up ‘purchase a gun for someone who can’t buy it themselves and you get 10 years in prison.’. . So without access to a doctor for sleeping pills or guns, what do I have left?. . I could run a hose from the car exhaust to the inside, but I don’t have a garage so I’d have to find someplace secluded enough that I could be alone while the CO does it’s thing.  I think CO would be an OK way to go, fall asleep and don’t wake up, which is what I’d want.  I don’t really want an overly messy death that someone else would have to clean up.  I think I remember hearing anti-freeze is a strong poison, but I don’t remember how it kills you.. . Not a big fan of jumping either, because it seems like it’d be messy and if you failed you might not be in good enough condition afterwards to ever try again.. ",suicide

"I don't know at all.Hey there. First of all I want to thank all the awesome people in this sub that are helping..  I am 15-17 years old and I think I might be suicidal. In the last few months (4-7) I've grown very tired of my life. I got tired of doing the same thing every day, but when I speak out about it, I get told that it's going to get better soon. But that's what I've been told for 4 years. There's nothing particularly wrong with my life; I have okay parents, I have something to eat and drink every day, I am not bullied or anything. That makes me think I am just overreacting, but I really wouldn't mind if I just wouldn't wake up tomorrow. On the other hand though, I feel like I would never kill myself. I don't even know what I expect from this thread. I guess I just want to know if I am ok and just in q typical ""I'm a teen and I'm sad"" phase or if I have depression/am suicidal.

"I just can't shake this hatred of myselfThis, might be a long story. Sit in for the long haul to hear the twisted tale of a twisted boy.. . I guess it all started when my parents got a divorce. My mother was a stripper who worked only weekends to pay my way through life. Nothing's better than having to tell all your friends at school that your mom is a stripper. Around 10th grade I got over it, and made it kinda a joke but I know the truth. My mother is someone . who sold her body.. . When I was a young boy, she fell in love with a drug lord. Rolling stones even did an article on this self-entitled ""cannabis kid."" I understand that weed isn't that bad of a drug, but to expose your 8 year old son to that environment is something I will never forgive her for. Sure, he went to prison for 12 years soon after they got together, but now he's out. She married him, and now she has another son with him. I still don't forgive him, and I won't forgive her. Yet, somehow, the entire family on her side has accepted him with open arms. I remember who he was. I remember how he used to scream at me and threaten me until I would sit in my room quietly just so that he could go fuck my mom.  . . She emotionally abused me all 17 years I lived with her. Terrorized me. She would threaten me to do literally anything. All she did was sit in her room and smoke pot. I cleaned the house. I cleaned my room. I packed everything when we moved, which was almost every year. If I didn't, she'd take away my phone, my laptop, any connection to anyone I used as support during these times. My family on her side was completely wrapped around her finger. She'd cuss, she'd scream, and she'd throw stuff at anyone who genuinely agreed that she was mistreating me. I tried running away several times only to be answered with the same response. ""Run away, and I'll call the police."". . I was caught cutting at school once, CPS was called and I had a chance out, right? Wrong. My mother poisoned me. Told me lie after lie after lie until I was too terrified to tell the CPS agent the truth. My only escapes from her was the internet, my room, and school. I've been crippled emotionally by her, and others as I explain more. . . My father did the best he could with me for the time he got. He used to fight tooth and nail just to see me. Every summer I'd spend time with him. It was my only breaks, not from school, but from the hell at home. When I was 10 I think, I was told I would live with him for a year. I spent the summer with him and was enrolled in school there. Got a crush on a girl, and my cousin helped me write a poem for her which she loved. The very next day after that, my father was exposed for abusing pills. CPS sent me back to my mother. . . Here's where I start making stupid mistakes. At the end of my freshman year of high school, I couldn't take it anymore. My mother broke into my room forcibly and took my phone because I 'didn't' give someone a glass of milk. I fought back. We wrestled to the ground over this phone. I wouldn't be subjugated anymore. The next morning she sent me on a flight to my father's again, who was clean now. I didn't even get to say goodbye to my friends... Or the love of my life, Elaine.. . Living with my Dad then wasn't so bad. Went to an alternative high school because I didn't keep up on my homework and was behind on credits. Made a few lifelong friends, who I still see from time to time. I had a great time. Well, that year the rule was reversed, and I had to spend the summer with my mom. I made a mistake that summer that will haunt me for the rest of my life and end this fairytale life I had with my father.. . Elaine and I were catching up, and a stupid phrase from my stupid heart changed my life. I asked her if she would be my girlfriend, because I hadn't confessed my feelings for her yet. She responded that she would... if I lived there. I had to call my dad the next morning and leave him a tear filled message that I would not be coming home at the end of the summer. That broke my dad's heart and our relationship was never the same. I spent another year and a half with that woman, and, surprise surprise, Elaine and I didn't get together for another year.. . We officially never got together, I suppose. Lots of hormone filled nights spending together during a ""Trial period"" we agreed to start because she was convinced by one of her friends to give me a shot. It was the best month of my life, but was simply that, a month long. I'm still recovering from the shock of her leaving me for her abusive ex boyfriend, who continued to abuse her for another year before she finally left him. Sometimes I wonder if I'm really any better than him, or if I truly am worse. I still love her dearly, and wholeheartedly. Too much, in fact.. . I cannot hold another relationship since then. I've had women tell me they love me and broken up with them on the spot. I cannot bring myself to love anyone, not the way I loved her, not what I would consider 'true' love. My father was still begging me for the whole year and a half to come ""home"" to his house. I had to keep refusing and telling him no because I was a stupid boy in love with a stupid girl. Still, in love with a stupid girl.. . Then, half way through my senior year, I saw the home stretch... Until my mother told me to get a haircut. This was an ongoing battle between her and I. I like my hair long, she likes it short. I was 18. I decided I can damn well decide how my hair looks. I'm an adult. She left me stranded in the middle of the city, and one of my friends from church had to skip dinner with his wife to take me home. I am still grateful that he was so gracious. When I got home, she told me that she would no longer would support me in any way, shape or form. We moved from Washington to Idaho so that she could be with her 'boyfriend' who just got out of prison. I was stranded. She told me come the very next day after graduation, I better have a place to live, because I wasn't welcome there.. . The next day, after a teary phone call, my dad came over the mountains and got me. Thus began the last stage of my life. Through sheer luck in a program in my home town, I was able to graduate on time. I felt like the king of the world. Everyone was there, including my mom who was baked out of her mind. My grandfather was so proud of me, my uncle was proud of me, everyone was. When I tried to push the pride away because I simply struck dumb luck, they all told me that it was me who did it. Me who accomplished this big thing... that felt like nothing to me. School was far too easy, the only thing I didn't do was homework and that's why my grades plummeted. . . After that, I got a job as a busser at Olive Garden. Moved out a few months after that and lived with two, supremely shitty roommates. They were a married couple, one who smoked pot to calm a medical disorder and the other who was just, like, my mother. I endured their hell for about 7 months before I had to return to my dad with my tail between my legs. They also introduced me to a woman who has been tearing me apart ever since. . . Her name is Missy, and they hooked the two of us up. She looked so much like Elaine that all this pent up aggression and sadness I had melted away for the chance to have a pseudo-Elaine love me. She was pregnant from her boyfriend before me, but that didn't bother me. I had someone who loved me and who I thought I loved. That's all I ever wanted, was to be loved. Surely my mother was incapable of giving me that kind of affection, and my dad still wasn't the same after I turned my back on him for Elaine. Right around this time last year, she left me. But she never let go of the grip she had on me. Constantly pulling me in with lies of ""I love you, but can't be with anyone right now"" and then bringing random dudes to work with her on dinner dates when she knows I'm working. She'd let them kiss her, or drape their arms around her, or generally act like they'd been together for ever all while whispering in my ear that she loved me. . . I'm so scared of being alone that I believe her. I'm so desperate for love that I'm willing to throw myself at a brick wall at the drop of a hat over and over again just for the chance of someone telling me that they love me and meaning it. I feel like a dirty dishrag, used and abused and loving every second as long as I'm not put down.. . Unfortunately, the real Elaine still has a much stronger psychological hold on me. I have three main best friends, Liz, Cj, and Elaine. Cj lives on my dad's side of the mountains near me, Liz and Elaine live on the other side where I grew up. I've come to Liz with my pain, with my confusion, and my anger about how Elaine treated me and, bless her heart, she tells me that my love is pure and that some day she just knows that Elaine will finally see that she loves me. It's a pipe dream I'm too desperate to ignore. Too hurt to reject. To stupid to push away because I need to be loved by someone, romantically. I feel like a failure as a man.. . Now my dad and his wife are having a kid and they both... hate me. I spend all my time in my room because it's where my mother taught me that it's the only safe haven I have. My father comes downstairs and pounds on my door like he's the FBI demanding I come spend time with the family, or he'll kick me out. When I do come upstairs to spend time with them, they all pick on me, my dad, his wife, and her two kids, thoroughly lash me with words until I'm too broken and defeated to fight back. So I slink back to my room to lick my wounds until the cycle repeats and repeats with added intensity every time that he comes downstairs. I live my life in fear. My only escapes are my music and a novel that I most likely will never finish. . . I hate my job but it's the only escape I have from them. I hate my life but what else can I do? I'm starting to think that this monument of shit that is the horrid frightened human being that is me's only escape is to kill myself and just... end it.

"Short and simple, I'm doing it tonight.I'm 22 and am disabled with schizo-affective and a panic disorder and irritable bowel syndrome (yes I'm being treated). And all my friends are doing so well and I'm just stuck here pulling in 600 a month. I want to work or go to school but I'm terrified of having stomach pain or a panic attack at work, plus my anti-psychotics make me tired all the time.. . . . .

"I think the girl I love moved away so I'm probably going to kill myself.Theres a girl I've been in love with/infatuated with/had intense feelings for,  for almost a year now.  I would go to her workplace a lot to talk to her and I asked her out but she had a boyfriend so she said no.. . This obviously made me sad but I understood and I really liked her so I wanted to at least be her friend.  I was okay with that.  But then she quit her job and the past few months shes only occasionally comes into my workplace and she would barely even say hi.  I haven't seen her in a few weeks and on her facebook it says she got a job in a town like 30 min to an hour away.  I thought we werwe at least becoming friends but she completely forgot about me.  I can't blame her I'm a forgettable piece of shit.  I can't move on from this girl I'm 22 and I've never even kissed a girl I'm so pathetic and I loved her.  . . At first I thought she liked me back, because a girl has never responded to me the way she did but I guess it was all just in my head.   I'm probably going to down as many pills as I can in the next few hours I can't be alone and I can't live knowing she just forgot about me that easily.. ",suicide

"How Do I Learn to Accept I’ll Never Have a Girlfriend or Normal Life?Hello, everyone. I’ve recently begun to think about an idea I came up with a long time ago: I will never have a girlfriend, much less a wife.. . This all began during high school. Like many others, I realized I was different. I have little to no social skills, laugh awkwardly, am not particularly attractive, and (I think) might be retarded. Whenever I would talk to girls in high school, they would react normally. We would have superficial conversations, crack jokes, and discuss classwork; however, we would never get too close. You could still tell they wanted to keep a distance between us.. . Flash forward to today, I’m a student at a college in the northeast. Every time I attempt to approach any girl (not for dates), she will either look at me with disgust or behave awkwardly and look away. Think of when Fiona realized Shrek was an ogre. Now, while I don’t particularly look attractive, I’m not a stereotypical NEET who never takes the time to shower. I shower, brush my teeth, smile, etc. Whenever I meet a girl, like I mentioned previously, we simply discuss academic topics.. . When I’m at work (food service), will girls shy away when they see me, and the female coworkers I have will observe me from the corner of their eyes. If I get too close to them (about 3/4 a meter), they’ll back away.. . From this, I have learned that women are quite literally repulsed by my existence. Is there anything I can do? I used to be slim (not skinny), but that didn’t help.. . Edit: I also want to mention I have already given up on dating and romance as a whole, though I can’t come to terms with it. I used to have a crush on a girl every day as a young boy and teenager, but now I don’t feel anything.",suicide

"Dying be defaultFound out today that I most likely have 2 different versions of cancer. My Doctor started talking to me about follow up and possible options. I stopped him there and said no further action will be taken. He knows I have episodes of severe depression, but today all I could muster was pure apathy. I honestly don't care about the diagnosis. If it is cancer it can do what it will. I will hide it for as long as I can and I've forbidden my doctor to speak to my husband, Hippa can be helpful at times. Can't even be called suicide, just a sudden onset of cancer that progressed rapidly. Maybe I'll even get lucky and have tumor lysis syndrome. The cancer cells burst open, intracellur electrolytes flood my blood stream and cause a massive arrhythmia and I die in my sleep. ",suicide

"Lost and alone from loss of boyfriendLike the title says I just feel so lost right now.  Last year my boyfriend of 7+ years was diagnosed with stage 4 melanoma.  On top of that, his parents have always hated me because I'm not the right race and they took the opportunity to force me out of his life by refusing to pay for any of his treatment if I continued living with him.  I was able to talk to him online and on the phone but it's not the same as being there and supporting somebody in that situation.  I always stayed positive while talking to him but with where the cancer had spread and how fast it had spread I really expected to lose him.  . . . Today, after not being able to reach him for the past few days I was able to find out from his sister that my boyfriend is not responsive to the world.  His cancer has progressed extremely aggressively and treatment is being stopped because it will only be postponing the inevitable and...keeping his body alive more than anything else.  . . After finding this out I got home to see an early valentine's day gift from my boyfriend.  My emotions are all over the place and I don't know what to do. Right now I don't feel like I am in imminent danger of killing myself but with how fast my emotions are swinging from numbness to hysteria...I really don't know.  More than anything, I just feel alone.  I feel like I lost one of the most important people in my life and because his parents never approved of me for really base reasons....I don't have final moments with him.  I don't feel like I could have ever had enough time to show him just how much I loved him and was proud of him.  I messaged him every day, several times a day...with pictures and messages of love and hope....but I just don't know if he really knew how much he meant to me and how loved he was.  He expressed so much regret over the last few months that the last little bit of time he had left on earth was going to be spent without me and our cat by his side.  I don't want to think that his last conscious thoughts were like that.  . . I'm only in my early 30s, I know there's no right time to lose the love of your life but I just feel so lost right now.  I feel like...I have my whole life ahead of me...but I have to spend it without him.   . ",suicide

Times been going faster since I first started high school (high school In my country starts in year 7)  It feels like I went to sleep, woke up and now I’m suddenly year 11, nearly 17 and already knowing what I’m doing with my life. It’s stupid and I hate it. I am NOT prepared for the real world.. And if I’m being honest, it’s scary knowing that you’re getting older and there’s nothing you can do about it..
