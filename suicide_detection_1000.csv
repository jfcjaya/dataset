"I'm sick of this cycle, I really want to die.I have been to doctors, and they have found nothing wrong with me besides IBS. Apparently that is the cause of all my problems. It's why I'm always restless, why I always have anxiety attacks, and why I can't stop my mind from racing. . . I recently lost my job and have missed out on 2 jobs.. I guess it looks strange when I have to ask them to excuse me while I run to the bathroom and use it. I have no money because I blew through my savings paying bills. I have another interview tomorrow but what's the point? I can't even afford anti diarrheal medicine so it's a guarantee I won't get the job. I'm just done with this cycle. Wake up (after my long night sleep of 30 minutes) use the bathroom. Attempt t eat something... use the bathroom. Watch 20 minutes of a show, use the bathroom. . . I've been to the doctor and they said its definitely IBS/anxiety, but so what? I'm close to homelessness, I would rather be dead than homeless shitting in my pants. I am just so angry that this is my life now. I want it to end. I actually went to the store earlier and tried to steal some medicine for anti diarrheal and , of course, I stopped to run to the bathroom. This is the ultimate low point of my life. Unless I win the lotto (kinda hard when I don't play) or some random relative dies and leaves me money, I don't see this improving. What's the point when it only gets worse? It's gotten to the point I fantasize about someone breaking into my house quietly and blowing my head off with a shotgun while I sleep. . . Tell me one good reason I shouldn't when homelessness is 100% the next step for me. I don't really have much family and I've become kind of a hermit over the years, so not really anyone I can ask for help. No medical insurance and no hope for anything. I don't even have a fucking cell phone anymore. Internet will be out in a week or so.. I'm surprised it's still on now it was due a few days ago. ",suicide
"Life is worth LosingI am diagnosed with GAD, social anxiety disorder, major depression and mood disorder and I am an asexual currently on the end of my ropes. . . I have no feasible options available to me financial, educational, therapytical support opportunities no friends for about 12 years and I have been a recluse for the last 2 years leaving my home only when it is an absolute necessity.. . My only valid reason for not being here is Family, it would absolutely destroy my mother and for that reason I have postponed my fate, the problem with the whole situation is if I explain how close I am in leaving my family would be forced to act that would cost them financialy and cause strain on my siblings as well. I would honestly like to be instituinalised as that is the most logical next step to save my soul but as all things are it is not free, you will only be taken into the public institution after a failed suicide attempt. I have never attempted it before I will only be able to follow through, as I believe a cry for help is false, you either are committed in doing what you want or not at all.. . I hardly express an emotion anymore, even facial expression has become non existent, apathy is my natural tendency these days. I have felt dead inside for years now. When my family speaks with me I listen however there is a wall so to speak were I just respond in the blandest of manner. I am always in my own head all the time while interacting with others. . . I am realising now that the time to take action has arrived, it might not be today, tomorrow or next week but I know that soon I am going kill myself.. . Sorry for the morbid post I just had to get it off my chest as each passing moment I am a step further in ending it all. . ",suicide
"Rant about school and how I was treated When I started primary school in reception my mum says I would hide under tables and refuse to come out / socialise with people. So I got put into a special club (two hours a week). To play games / socialise with people / your special and need help. So I was in this club until I finished primary school. ( To be fair it was fun but I missed out on essential learning (maths English etc) I would come back and be confused on what was happening. This special club also did other things meaning I missed out on ruffly a day of learning a week. Not too bad but it adds up. I found it hard to make freind's since I kept leaving the classroom and being payed special attention. I was treated with a light touch. Then in year 5-6 I was out into counseling. Another one hour a week just drawing and talking to an adult for no reason at all except to make sure I'm fine. . . Then I went to secondary school, on the first day I was took to an office and they checked that I was fine. I was in learning support for English during year 7. But in year 8 I moved out of it then in year 9 I was in top set. I finished school with a 7 in English GCSE, that k was proud of.I didn't need any extra help or support when I was secondary school, they treated me like I was just normal and it was great. But I was always am confused why I was given so much help and support in primary school when it just made me feel alienated and seperated from everyone in my class, just because I was shy as little kid (4). . . Now I'm 16. Still a little shy but so annoyed at how I was treated in primary school and all the education I ended up missing out on, to play with puppets or make a clay pot.",non-suicide
"It’s a really weird feeling being around peopleNo one has any idea what I’m planning. No one knows that I’m going to die soon. I almost feel guilty sitting next to my family and friends, having full knowledge that soon, I’m going to be gone. These moments are the last moments we’ll spend together. They have no idea, because to them it’s just no big deal. We’re just hanging out, like any other day. But I’m going to be dead soon. . . I’m sorry.",suicide

"I'm 32. And I logically think it'd be better if I ceased to exist. I'm not feel really emotional or anything right now, I'm quite calm actually. . . I'm not sure where to start. But for as long as I can remember, I've been depressed. I always felt like I had to fake positive feelings. Happiness has never truly lasted for me, it's come and gone. . . When I was 20, I met a girl on the internet (mIRC). We fell in love and I flew to Australia. I was born in the Netherlands and I'm currently still living in Aus.. Anyway. After 6 years she broke up with me because my mental issues were too stressful. And my heavy depression took her down to that level too. . After we broke up and she lied to me for a year I developed serious anxiety disorder. It took me a while to get that under control. . But ever since then I've just been incredibly depressed. Sometimes I'd get the energy back and I'd jump into the world again.. all excited and what not, only for things to blow up in my face. Mainly because of my own errors. . Anyway, that girl I was with.. I decided to stay quite close to her because I still cared about her. She made a great friend. . 2 years ago she moved to London. I was happy for her. Aaand I did miss her quite a bit since we had such a strong bond. . . A week ago she came over for her brother's wedding. She saw me a few times but only with her fiance present, I could never really speak to her alone or anything. . 2 days ago we were originally supposed to meet up the day before she'd fly back. . She changed her mind and said she'd rather do something other than hang out with me. I asked her why, and she said.. that I'm just too depressing to be around. . . This hit me pretty hard. . And I realised I'm just not a great guy to be around at all. I'm negative. . I've just given up on life. . Don't have a job. Haven't had one in a while since they all just go bad. I can't handle them emotionally, the anxiety gets ridiculous. . I have to real prospects. . . Now that she's stopped caring about me.. and she's the only person I thought really did... then well... . I don't see the point anymore. . . Like I said. I'm not sad or emotional at the moment. I'm just currently thinking of ceasing to exist. In the most painless way possible. . I'm quite at peace with the entire idea. ",suicide
I WAS JUST ACCEPTED TO MY DREAM UNIVERSITY OH MY GOD I DID IT,non-suicide
I have no hope left. I really don't know how to keep going.Im 29 and My life is basically over and I don't know how to go on.. . I've been sick for like 5 years with horrible stomach issues and getting very dizzy when I don't eat. I have horrible brain fog and I can barely focus on anything. . . I finally figured it out after my doctor basically gave up on me and wanted to try all these weird mental drugs like thorazine a fucking schizophrenia med. I found out I have sibo it's bacterial overgrowth in your intestines. It's very hard to cure and I have to be on a diet of no alcohol no dairy no wheat no grains almost no fruit basically just chicken fish jasmine rice and vegetables. I'm supposed to eat like 15 pills a day. I kept it up for like 5 months but this past month I've just given up. My life is so fucking horrible I just want to die. My doctor did some tests and my blood work shows that I might have cancer or organ damage. I have a CT scan Feb 11th and it's all downhill from there. I'm supposed to have my 3rd endoscopy and a colonoscopy too. Test after test with no improvement and more problems each time. I've been on this diet for 6 months now and spent thousands on treatments that never worked.. . I have a severe case of generalized anxiety disorder and I refused to take ssri because I didn't want them to mess up my head. I tried to get benzos from multiple doctors but no luck. I have no relief ever from this constant suffering.. . I snapped last year when my best friend died and a girl I was seeing tried to kill herself the night before his funeral. She sent me pics of her taking benzos and wine and then passed out so I had to call the cops to help her. She told me she hated me more then anyone when they showed up to revive her. My friend had died from choking on his vomit after too much booze and benzos.. . I snapped and smashed my whole house. Many of my favorite possessions were destroyed.  All my friends stopped talking to me because i snapped and I ended up living with this girl for a while and we got together. Even friendships like 12 years old stopped because I snapped. Things were not great we fight a lot and she has hit me a few times in the past but I have no other friends so I still see her. It is nice to atleast have someone to talk to instead of sitting in my house alone every day.. . I got too sick to work and had to quit my job. Ran out of money and I have to move back in with my parents at the end of the month. I'm totally freaking out about that.. . I can't see anything in my life improving. I had such bad brain fog and anxiety I can't learn anything new. My job was all physical labor and I'm too sick for that now. I lost all my friends and I'm too sick and depressed to even leave my house let alone make friends. I burp constantly all day and I'm really gross to be around. I'm super high maintainance and I have to have a premade meal with me every where I go.. . I can't see anything more for my life then sitting around my parents house watching TV til they kick me out and I move into some shitty room on welfare and do nothing alone until I die.. . I really don't see the hope anymore. I used to smoke weed to calm down and every time I smoke now I just get panic attacks so I literally have 0 relief whatsoever.. . I don't want to live anymore. I'm really contemplating killing myself. This is a pathetic excuse for a life.,suicide

"I'm not really sure where this whole thing is headed.I don't even know where to start here. I've had what I could only describe as crippling anxiety that causes or feeds into depression all the time. Chronically. My friends don't understand what it's like minus one of my best friends, and even then I don't feel like I can talk to any of them. I just feel like a burden when I bring it up even though they all tell me that ""they'll always be there for me"" and I can ""talk about anything to them."" I just always talk myself out of it because I can fucking tell when I'm being a burden with it. My best friends love me near unconditionally, but I know there's only so much a human can take.. . This is only compounded by the fact that I'm gay and am probably attracted to my best friends. I may get over it one day, but I can't convince myself now. My likes and interests are so out of sync with the ""general gay community."" My friends are getting into relationships, which is causing my brain to not only be super jealous because of my general feelings for them, but also to go into panic mode because I do not believe that there is someone for everyone. My anxiety causes me to be a mess to be around and my deeper problems seem almost completely unrelatable.. . I'm absolutely rambling now because I have nowhere to put these feelings down. I've struggled with suicidal thoughts my entire adolescence and I never wanna burden my friends with them because I put them on a pedestal and I value them more than anything. I'm not really sure why I should carry on.. . I kind of wish I was dead just for a while to see how it would affect everyone. Call me selfish, spiteful, fucked up, whatever. I just don't feel like I have any meaningful impact on people's lives. People tell me I do, but it feels bullshit. I can't convince myself of it even though they're being entirely genuine. After all, what do you tell someone who's going through something like that ""no, I don't think of you that much, you don't mean too much to me, I'd miss you for a while, but honestly I'd get over it?"". . I've stopped myself from doing it so many times. I keep a note written and updated and that helps sometimes because I'd hate to supposedly let so many people down. But it's hard. It's hard to keep going. This seems like a much simpler solution. I wouldn't have to worry about feeling anxious all the time. I wouldn't have to worry about what people think. I'd be dead. I wouldn't have to worry about what people would think of me after or if they would show up to my funeral. I'd be dead.. . Sure I'm selfish, whatever. But the struggle doesn't feel worth it. I'm too much of a leech. I'm just ready to have it all be done.",suicide

"The Ultimate Way OutIt's my second post here and sad to say, things get even worse. And sad to say, i am still alive.. . It may sounds odd, but sometimes i'd prefer to be just an emo-phase-kid pretending to have suicidal thoughts. I'd really rather prefer to post here as an attention seeker feeling ""suicidal"" for a couple of hours, than to post here as me. I just came to conclusion, that everything i have left is to keep living next months, next years, in a loop of soothing suicidal phantasies, desperately searching the smallest reasons for ""not today"" scenario. Just as earlier.. . I don't know what am i doing with my life in this shitty job, but i keep doing it, because i must keep fucking biologically functioning, no matter how deadly i want to choose the ultimate way out. Doesn't it even sounds nice? The ultimate way out.. . I must keep going for my friends, for my family. I don't want to ruin their lives, i don't want them to cry. As simple as that. I am tired. I don't really want to keep going anymore. I don't want to do all this shit again. I don't want to be me.

"I'm really struggling and my mother hasn't changed, she still emotionally neglects me just like how it was when I was a child I have depression, anxiety and PTSD from my abusive father who abused me for years, tried to rape me when I was 7 (my mom forced me to see him as a child cause he ""paid child support even though I would come home crying my eyes out every time after seeing him). She emotionally neglected me entirely. I cried and she just walked away. Nobody believed me when I said what he was doing to me. I fell into a deep depression at 14, had my first suicide attempt, I backed out because I was scared so then I just really shut down. I became mute, never smiled for years, didn't look anyone in the eyes, started starving myself.  I was like a zombie. I lost 40 pounds in 2 months. I then also self harmed. I was in so much pain and I was just neglected and my mom didn't even want to take me to my psychiatrist appointment. I was looked at with disappointment with her sighing in disgust, and all she could say was ""You're fucking stupid. You're ridiculous. You're making me look bad. If you want to kill yourself go do it when you live on your own. I'm not going to fucking jail for you."". . I'm 20 now. I'm in college taking 4 classes that takes up my whole day starting at 8:30 am all the way until 8 pm at night and I don't get home until 10 pm because the buses take longer at night. Then I have to be up at 6:30 am THE NEXT DAY to be at work by 7 am and I don't get done work until 6 pm.  I live with my mom's side of the family. I have to come home to my toxic family everyday. My grandfather is the worst, he is a trump supporter and he hates me because I'm the first born mixed child in this white family. He calls me an animal, the N word and I get blamed for everything in the house even though I'm barely home. He throws trash in my room, throws things at me. When I was 8 years old he killed my turtle by putting bleach in his tank and he killed two frogs that I had.. . At 18 I got into an extremely abusive relationship with a 36 year old who emotionally damaged me even more than I already was because he raped me, lowered my self-esteem and made me feel horrible and ugly, just like my father did years ago which led me to starve and self harm myself. I thought I was doing okay but then I got in this relationship and everything got worse with me mentally/emotionally. . . I'm dealing with all of my mental disorders from all of the trauma I had as a child, I'm dealing with it ALL on my own, no therapist, no medication and when I try to express my feelings to my mom about how stressed and overwhelmed I am, saying I don't know how much I can take, I just get blatantly shut down by her.  All she can say is ""a lot of people have it a lot harder and worse. You aren't even doing that much for you to be acting like that."" It's like I get zero emotional support, zero compassion. Like my problems literally don't even matter at all. I open up about my feelings and I get shut down immediately. It's like she doesn't want to hear it. She doesn't even try to understand. I had so much shit happen to me and I'm struggling with my mental illness and she doesn't even help me one bit. I'm so alone. I have no friends. Nothing. I just want to end my life already.

"It’s me again. I’m so sick and miserable.. As I’ve said before, I’ve been sick for a while now with some sort of stomach ailment. For the last ten months, I’ve had extreme dizziness and nausea every single day, along with various other symptoms that come and go. Right now, I’m in some sort of flare where I can barely eat or drink again. I’m trying to force plain rice and water down my throat so I don’t starve to death or get too dehydrated. I’m starving, but my body won’t let me eat. I’ve already lost seven pounds in eleven days. Every time I sit up, my throat and tongue tense up and I feel very nauseous. I try to stay laying down, but sometimes even that doesn’t help and I just have to suffer through the nausea until it decides to go away. Throughout this ordeal, I’ve had hardly any help from doctors, who are very quick to blame my mental heath issues. Ive been to the ER 7 times, been admitted to the hospital once and lost 34lbs the first time around. Despite all this, my primary care physician suggested I just keep going to the ER to. manage my issue. Meanwhile, ER doctors are telling me to eat and getting mad when I can’t force down even a spoonful. of jello. I begged my PCP for help until he sent me to a gastroenterologist, who conducted one test, decided he couldn’t help me, then referred me to a different specialist. I wasn’t able to get an appointment for nine months. I’ve been waiting 7 months and still have two more to go, but probably more since COVID-19 has delayed so many appointments. I’ve tried all kinds of medicines for nausea, dizziness, inflammation. I’ve even tried herbal remedies out of desperation. Nothing has worked. Some made me feel worse. My number one fear in life is vomiting, so even I start to feel even the slightest bit queasy, I get tense and panicky. I spend most of my time laying in my bed, with nothing to do because I can’t sit up. I live with my mom who is a controlling, abusive cunt with narcissistic tendencies. I have a lot of time to sit and think about how much I hate her. I’m at the point now where I wish she would just die, so I could have some peace, but if that happened, I would be homeless, as I am disabled and have no friends or other family to help me. Not to mention most of my family were/are just as abusive as my mom is. My therapist seems to think I’m doing well enough that I only need to see him about every other month. Before I got sick ten months ago, I had sessions every other week. I had to stop because at that time, my nausea was so bad I couldn’t talk, much less go to sessions. Now I feel like he’s trying to get rid of me. My caseworker always seems to be going on vacation and I don’t really feel like Im being supported. I haven’t felt the touch of another human being for so long. I just want someone to hold me, comfort me and make me feel loved and wanted. I can’t even cry because it makes me nauseous. I don’t have a plan or anything but Im just so tired of this life. It has brought me nothing but pain in exchange for nothing. Having mental heath problems was bad enough, but now that I’m physically sick too, I have nothing. I don’t have a plan or anything, but something has got to give because I can’t take this anymore. I’ve friction burned my hand punching my bed repeatedly and now I’m out of breath and nauseous again. I just want to fucking die.",suicide

"Need someone to talk to, x-post with r/depressionI need help.  Someone to talk to, or help me vent, something.  I moved to this new city, where I know nobody.  My wife and I both came here.  I was already depressed.. . She was literally my world.  Even now, five months after we split, I'm desperately in love with her and don't know what to do.  But I hate her.  Kind of.  She had an affair.  Emotional for sure, possibly physical.  Especially with out it played out, I believe it was physical.  I've had a fairly rough life, with an abusive step-father, drug-addled mother, and growing up on my own as a lower class family on welfare.  I'm doing alright for myself, but I know nobody. . . I've always been a loner, because I grew up with one friend.  I confided everything in him, and he was all the support I needed.  Just the one person.  When I met my wife, I joined the military and we moved away.  She became everything to me.  I didn't need other friends (serious ones, I had work friends and the casual hang out friend), so when we moved away to this new town I once again knew nobody.. . However, once we got here, we started growing distant.  She met this guy, started hanging out with him, and that was it.  She started going on dates, even spent my fucking birthday on a date with him, showing up past 5pm with gifts I specifically said I hadn't wanted (Fallout 4, had no interest in game) and having bailed on the one thing I wanted, that we always did (going out to dinner together; she ate with him).  . . A bunch of other shit happened, I finally broke up with her.  I was scared, desperate, and lonely.  I took too long breaking up with her, and she just hurt me more and more.  I finally had to plan my own break up, because every time I tried previously, she'd sweet talk me back into staying.  How it would work out, etc.  So I actually plan my own break up.   Wasn't that a fun fucking weekend.. . Now, it's months later, and I feel like I'm falling apart.  I've spent essentially four months completely alone.  I don't know anybody here.  I'm not on speaking terms with any of my family.  I cut ties with that original friend years ago because he took a bad path in life and was a terrible influence.  I just *don't know what to do*, and I'm scared because I feel like everything is falling apart.  And it hurts.  and I'm *scared*, because I can't control myself, or my thoughts, or anything.

"2929. . . That’s the oldest I’ve ever been. It’s the oldest I’m ever meant to be.. . . I don’t remember when I had the first dream. It probably happened when I was so young that I wouldn’t even be able to remember. They are always fragmented and real… Real in the way that when it ends, your eyes open and you’re lying in bed wondering.. . . “Did I just wake up… or just fall asleep.”. . . The fragments don’t seem to follow a timeline; just clips like a hazy recollection of a night out. Remembering moments out of a long series of events.. . . In these dreams, I’ve seen the events of my life, tragic and wonderful, play out before me. Sometimes months or years before they are experienced in the chronological timeline.. . . It took time to get used to having these dreams; especially the dark ones, the ones where a friend or family member passes and I’m forced to spectate as a silent observer in their final moments. It wasn’t until my teens that I felt like I understood what they were. As stupid as it sounds, clairvoyance runs in the family. If you believe in that type of thing. I’ve cousins who experience the same. We’ve talked about them, shared our different perspectives of events yet to come and those that we didn’t understand until the timeline unfolded in front of us.. . . 29. . . Out of the thousands of dreams, every one of which that has so far played in my synapses, not one of them shows me past the age of 29. My 30th birthday is now less than 60 days away.. . . I’ve lived with suicidal ideation for nearly two decades now. Before I had ever met my wife, I had come to a decision. I wasn’t going to live past the age of 27, in fact I was going to end my life on my 27th birthday. I can’t say for certain why I chose 27… Partially because I was an angst filled young adult who thought if I was going to die young, I should join the group of others who died famously young at 27 (except I’m far from famous). 27 also happens to be my favorite number, I could not tell you why, I’ve always just been drawn to it.. . . When my 27th birthday rolled around I was a newlywed of 3 months. To say that ending my life on that day was the last thing on my mind then would be to lie to you. The plan I’d concocted still toiled about in my brain that day. But my plans had changed.. . . 29. . . It began to stand out in my mind that the dreams never showed me past a certain age. The limit was always twenty-nine. There are none where I’m a proud father, watching my children go. None of me in my golden years enjoying life with my wife who’s aged so much better than I over the years. After 29, they just stop.. . . We fixate on negatives, humans that is. It’s an exercise in willpower and determination to train ourselves to focus on the positives in life and not dwell on the negatives. I’m far from being a master at this myself.. . . “Why don’t I see myself as older than 29 in any of these?”. . . Is it because that’s when my story ends? Will my life be destined to have a dash between 1987 -2017? Am I finally going to break in the next two months and have the gumption to take my own piece off the game board?. . . Or is it something more positive… Does the family’s clairvoyant trait only take us so far in life? Is it a gift we are given to be shown, in part, the events of our future that will violently shape the people we will become? Glimpses to show us that, no matter how low and dark things are going to get, you are going to make it through this?. . . Maybe we aren’t clairvoyant. Odds are it’s just the family disposition for schizophrenia, another wonderful future to look forward to thanks to inherited genetics. I’ve already been dealing with auditory hallucinations since childhood, though one might argue those spawned from abuse and not genetics.. . . Is it going to end at 29… am I going to see the other side of 30? If I don’t, is it going to be my own doing? Maybe I’m not allowed to see how my own story ends, not until I experience it first hand, so as to not spoil the moment.. . . I don’t make a conscious effort to avoid my suicidal ideation. I did at one point, but then I accepted that part myself. The part that feels, knows, that suicide is an option. I can’t say I go more than a week without at least the tiniest thought of it coming into my mind. That thought of throwing yourself into the void when staring into it. The thoughts just happen and like other thoughts they are sometimes discarded immediately. Others are turned and inspected; what-if situations played out over and over.. . . “How would she react?”. . . “What would the funeral look like?”. . . How many dominos would fall if I cast my own down? Some may topple like my own, but there would be many that would wobble for ages… Likely never settling back down into their original position.. . . That’s the hardest hurdle for me, in regard to bringing myself to committing to ending it myself. My empathy for those in my life, knowing or at least thinking I know how my life ending would impact theirs. More so if it was self-inflicted.. . . It has always been easy to hurt myself. Intentionally hurting others that I care about though, has always felt impossible. I know I’ve caused harm to them without the intention of doing so and felt immense guilt after the fact, again and again. So I’ve never been able to follow through with a plan because of the line of thinking that happens at that point of the planning.. . . Within the next two months am I going to finally disregard others’ feelings and selfishly satisfy my own, I’m not even sure what to call it, desire or what I believe to be my stories already written ending? Perhaps it does end, but not by any doing of myself. Just the chaos of existence.. . . With some luck, maybe… Just maybe 29 isn’t the end… It’s just a new beginning.. ",suicide

"School is making me suicidal, depressed, I hate everyone there. In high school, I've met some of the worst people in my whole life. And it's not only 1, not 2, it's more than half of the classroom I'm in. First off everything was great I thought it was a good class, but then one moron has changed school and moved into our class. He acted like a jerk from the beginning, everyone, of course, was so obsessed ""how funny he is"" with his elementary school humor and acting like a fucking child. In my country, you are an adult at the age of 18 and most of them are like 16 - 17 and they still act like fucking kids. That wouldn't be that big of a deal. But then for some reason, he began to have a problem with my friend. It all started with a nickname (as my bullying has) and ended with sending her nude pictures into class group chat and making fun of her because she cut herself because of their nonstop verbal abuse. Not talking about my fucking ex that I spent 6 months trying for, then she told she can't date younger guys and ended up dating the guy that is the same age as me and that she called ""a fucking asshole, she couldn't even talk to"". I really wanna drop out, but my family won't support me even if I tell them how hard it's to work in that class and that I have no intention of doing the specialization I've chosen and I'm studying now.

Before this past week, my worst moment was when I had a fleeting thought of suicide back in high school.

They switch between subjects so much, you can’t learn what it is and they barely touch the surface. There was an episode where it’s about tensile strength? I don’t get why they would try to teach and I emphasize again, preschoolers, something that I don’t even know. They don’t even do much with it. They have a granny lady swing with a rope. That’s kind of it. Sometimes they’ll be teaching about something, and they’ll switch to something totally different. Another thing is they have no new characters.

"Wish I never existedI don't even know where to begin at this point. My whole life I have tried. I tried to be a good son to my parents. I really never was rebellious or anything. If they said be home by a certain time in high school I was always home by then, or I would have called to tell them why I'm not home. I always tried hard in school so that they would be proud of me. I got good grades, I tried hard to get those grades. I was always nice to people, I was always the guy if someone needed something done I never minded helping. I always helped friends and family with moving, computer help, or really anything. I always would call my family to see how everyone has been. I was good. I don't know if it was me as a person, or some of it being I was raised to believe in a god that blesses those that do well. My grandpa died recently. Without expecting any thanks or whatever I put together the program and made a slideshow to play at the service. But despite doing all of this I can't seem to get any where in life. I try and try and try, and all that ends up happening is I get hurt and frustrated. I have tried to get into med school for the last two years. I did a master's program. During the programs hardest quarter right before finals I had to get my appendix removed, and then I developed an abscess. I was in the hospital for almost two weeks total. I toughed it out and took the finals so that I could submit them to the med school and hopefully get an interview. Then one class loses my grades for almost three weeks, so I get my interview later. Sometimes people from the program get in some don't. I was in the later category. Now this year rolls around, I decide to apply again with everyone else. Now everyone who I was friends with has gotten in, even though I know I got better grades than some of them. I just can't win. I have been on depression medication for some time. It helps me sleep at night, but before I go to bed every night the only wish I have anymore is to never have existed. I know sometimes I fantasize about killing myself so that all of this suffering would be over, but I don't want to cause my family anymore pain. I don't need their to be some afterlife where I can remember the good times, or exist as someone else, or anything like that. I just wish the I would fall asleep and that would be it.

"There's no other optionHi all,. . Sorry for the burn account but I'd rather not have this tired to me. All my life I've had bad luck with pain and medicine. Now in my mid 20s have had numerous spine surgeries, stomach disorders, depression, etc as well as shitty friends. Can't catch a break, that's for sure.. . But today I was in the ER in the worst pain of my life. It's been getting worse you see, but nothing like this. Curled up, grabbing my stomach, screaming for my mom level of pain. And surprise surprise, as always, there was no problem to be found. I've actually toyed with the idea that I'm spiritually cursed. You may laugh, I sure did once, but it's the only way to explain this constant almost mystical pain that is apparently neither physical or mental. Maybe I was a shit in a past life and have to accept reincarnation. Maybe god/the universe hates me. Hell, maybe I'm just supposed to be dead.. . What's worse is I am both a known occultist and psychologist. My life revolves around control of oneself and helping others, yet I'm helpless to control or help myself. I'm a hypocritical failure **at best** in the area I truly dedicated myself too. This all is probably what lead to a 20+ year old man cutting for the first time since high school. Fuck ""cutting"", more like mutilating my leg with a knife. But it doesn't help. There's no pain quota to reach or absolution for unknown ""sins"", just a pathetic man with no control harming his own body - the ultimate no no of psychology and occultism alike.. . And tonight I realized it's all futile. Whatever is wrong with my, be it fluke or god,will only get worse. Infinitely. Until I die. I will never get to live my life, never find happiness or peace or comfort. Those who love me are simply trapped in my eternal prison as well. My efforts for health and happiness will always fail. Which brings me to the interesting point in all this - suicide as the most level headed and realistic option. Not a reaction or anything suicide is usually made out to be. The only choice that is rationally is for me to kill myself. Nobody would even blame me.",suicide

"It's been a rough 6 yearsI'm 22, F, and for as long as I can remember, I have thought about killing myself.. . (Currently drinking, please excuse any and all spelling mistakes). . I always thought having suicidal thoughts and tedencies was normal, because of the people I hung out with, but as I got older, I realise that is no longer the case.. . I've been on and off medication for about a year and a bit, ad the first batch on meds I was on, was the worst thing ever (sertralie 50mg), I took that for about 6 months on an off, just to have a bit of normalcy in my lif. Recently, I've been put on a lower dose (Citalopram 20mg) which has started out great. I didn't feel like a zobie, i didn't feel weak walking, or even sitting up. I could keep food down. I felt like a normal huan being. That was about 5 weeks ago. I've always been suicidal, from a very young age, but I never told my family about it. Now that my family knws about it, they keep sayibg I have no reason to feel or be suicidal, just like m=I have no reason to be depressed. I took a day off from work today, and I got told, I'm throwing everyone in the shit for today, which ust piled on to how I was feeling.. . I'm currently drining wine, and may drink another bottle, and see if I am coscious enough to take some pills. Ive never really used this place, but it seemed like a good place to just kind f let things go. I dont expect any sort or form of response on this.

"Finally set a date!Heads up: This sucks. I find it comforting, but it sucks. I am by no means advocating for suicide. I just had to tell someone. I don't want to be judged or pitied or guilted. I just need someone to listen and make me feel sane for a bit.. . Also using my main account cause... well... it doesn't fucking matter anymore.. . Now, without further ado.... . Over the past few months my suicidal ideation has spiked through the roof. Whoop whoop! Odd, considering how great my life has been. I got an amazing job, had an amazing support system, and was doing pretty well with the boys. Went to the gym 6 days a week, ate healthy, had financial stability, and I loved and felt love. Yet, I want nothing more than to fucking die - thanks genes, you did me dirty like you did my grandfather who also killed himself.. . I always knew I was suicidal, but was always religious enough to not commit to it. Cause God sends people who suffer from mental illness to a place of eternal torment (/s). So for unrelated reasons I became an atheist about a a year ago. Since then, the thought of an afterlife slowly started dissipating from my head. With that, the ever growing *I could die and it wouldn't matter* started popping more and more frequently. My breaking point was in May when I sat down and committed myself to buying a gun but got too sleepy to drive all the way to the nearest store. I slept, felt better in the morning, and thought that I better get help.. . My motivation was my incredible and beautiful circle of friends and family. They deserve a try, it thought. Thus, I sought professional help and started getting medicated, but I still felt suicidal a month later (even if it isn't as bad as it was prior to that).. . Anyways. I set a date yesterday and it's been the most exhilarating feeling ever. I have never felt so alive before. Today, I created a list of contacts I want to write letters to. This is reserved to the people I truly love and will regret causing this much pain to. I am now at 16 letters, including family. I plan on throwing away the rest of my pills tonight. I don't want to hesitate when the time comes. I'll be ordering a gun online. Probably a rifle since it's cheaper. Plus, I'm not 21, which in PA means I'm not allowed a handgun.. . I'll be dying on the 24th of August. It's the Saturday before university starts. I wanted as much time as possible to make memories with the people I love. Not for my sake, but for theirs. I never want any of them to feel as though they could've done better. No one could have.. . This really does suck. There's SO much I wanted to do. I wanted to write a fantasy novel with some  LGBTQ representation. I wanted to travel the world. I wanted to start my own company. Maybe even run for political office. I wanted to own a farm - I fucking love cows and I really wanted to raise a few. I wanted to raise a kid and watch them become happy and successful. I know this all sounds cliche. But guess what, I'm dying in a month so I don't fucking care what people think anymore!. . It feels amazing. I feel like I could quit my job, kick my feet up, and eat junk food for the next month with no consequence. But I can't do that yet. Some of my close friends are suicide counselors. They know the signs. They've already started asking questions. I'm sure they know what's up. I just don't think they know how urgent it is. Right now I'm just going through the motions, trying to stay positive for everyone. This month isn't mine anymore. It's for the people I love. I'll make sure they're happy with how we end things. Until then, good luck to y'all. I hope it never gets as bad for you as it did for me. It really does suck. Regardless of what my brain feels right now, I still have tiny nugget of rationality left that knows how shitty this is.",suicide
"I feel like I wasted my life at 18. GoodbyeAll of my life I’ve been made fun of for being different. Compared to my siblings, I think I’m considered a failure. They are all good at basketball, I have no clout no talent. I have no friends and no one wants to be around me. Everyone calls me ugly and trash behind my back. I get weird stares from people and I got rejected by a girl I liked. No one wants me. I never really made any high school memories as I only learned how to drive going into senior year so I was basically stuck at home. I’m 6’4 and I’m not even good at basketball. I tried my hardest practicing everyday but I quit at sophomore year because I wasn’t getting good. No matter how hard I practiced, I was never good at the sport. Now I’m a senior and I feel like I completely wasted my potential. I ran track to stay in shape, but I was never really passionate about it. I worked hard in AP classes in high school and I finished in the top ten percent but I’m still going to a community college. I feel like all my hard work was wasted, seeing all the students in my school going to a university while I go to a community college.

"Never felt this way beforeI've found myself extremely unhappy with where I am in life, and as cliché as it is to say, extraordinarily alone. I'm a 20 year old guy, joined the Army last year, and was generally happy with my decision to do so. I knew what to expect. However, about two months ago I started having feelings of what I assume is depression, but I've never felt it before. I started eating less, going out less, and my workout life dropped dramatically. I miss home, not even the people as much as simply where I am from. My sleeping has been greatly affected as well, I can't seem to sleep through the night, I don't have nightmares but continuously wake up as if I've been surprised by something. I tried sleep aids for that but they only seemed to help marginally. I never thought of self harm before, I don't even want to now. But I have the thoughts, some kind of urge that's been growing. That's the hardest part, that I don't want the the urges, but they are there. I'm extremely hesitant to talk to people in my life about this, I don't know what they're reactions would be and frankly I don't want to know. I'm honestly embarrassed. People know me as the motivated, accomplished, and happy guy that I've always been. Talking to the support established here for help is even further from what I would do. There have been two suicides here recently so it's being taken more seriously than ever. I'm afraid of damaging my career, and my reputation. I don't even know if people would believe me. I don't want to feel like this, and I have no clue what to do. I hate having regret in my life but every day I go over the life changing decisions I have made and question them. I hate where I am in life, and I hate that I feel this way about myself. I know that self harm is no solution, but than why do I have the urge.

"will it get better?  It is uncertain if it will get better. The vague uncertainty actually holds both of the answers. I think the slight chance of getting better is what gets people going. But when u look at it ,it is not a slight chance., it is 50/50 if i make sense. It\`s how u carry what u mean by better. If you\`re hurting today ,you will never hurt the exact way you did the previous day. The effect of this might be the slightest but if you carry a sense of REALIZATION that it is indeed getting better. You possess an aura of positivity around you,you learn ,you realize,you are getting better. Now i know this does not apply to people facing traumatic situations daily ,but noone ever chooses that this is it,it won\`t get any better. You might sub-consciously have that sense of negativity .

"i will never be good enough.29/m. . me and my brother were raised by our mother, regardless to say we are extremely poor. we have barely been able to get by our entire lives, because we were so poor i dropped out of highschool when i was 17 to get a job, my grades were garbage anyways so i said fuck it. so career wise i am basically stuck to be your run of the mill fast food worker for the rest of my life. just a few months ago i was making 9.50 an hour at a job i hated working for a terrible human being. i asked for a raise, and he told me i wasnt worth it, so i quit. . . it wasnt always so bad though, a couple years ago i was working for marriott, making 13.25 for an amazing company that i genuinely loved, but of course with my life there is always something that is going to be negative. my supervisor was a parasite of a human being. he would harass us constantly, luckily enough i wasnt female because working with him as a woman would have been hell on earth. my cousin, who worked with me had a rumor spread around by this guy that they had been sleeping together. her husband found out and put a huge strain in their marriage, she went to hr as well as our executive sous chef in tears because of what this man did, and nothing was done about it. he works for marriott to this day. (he also threatened to fight me if i went to a party that the rest of my coworkers were going to be at one time, also he invited me to go golfing with him if i brought my girlfriend at the time, telling my other co-workers that he was going to try to steal her from me even though hes married.) the pressure from this person eventually made me quit. . . to this day i regret that decision. it was the biggest mistake of my life. i was so happy at that point in my life, i was making decent money, i had my own apartment and i was dating the girl of my dreams, we were engaged and living together. i was so happy with my life. things changed though. quitting marriott was what set me down this spiral. . . ex girlfriend moved back in with her parents but we were still together and engaged, but we were long distance at this point, so i decided to move to the coast with my best friend at the time. got a call center job down there and life went on. i was making 9.50 at the call center, which was miserable. by the end of my day i felt like i wasnt human, i spent 8 hours a day on the phone talking to people in distress, it took a toll on me to the point where i basically would start drinking the moment i got home, sometimes id start before i got home because i would hit up the gas station as i left, id buy myself some tall boys and drink them on the way home. i felt so depersonalized and the last thing i wanted to do when i got home was talk on the phone with my girlfriend. we grew apart until she eventually left me. . . this is where things really went downhill. i was livid at first, i wanted to do anything i could to hurt her, because she had found another boyfriend not even a week after she left, which makes me feel she was cheating on me again. i mean looking back at it now i know that it was all because of me, choices i made. it still tears me apart to this day. its almost been a year and i am just not over it. i dream about her ever single night. there is not one single day that i do not think of this woman and it hurts, it hurts me so bad. . . after she leaves i immediately feel the need to kill myself. i quit my job that day, talked to my mom on the phone for a bit for what i felt was the last time. talked to my roommate for a bit when he came home that night, not about anything that was bothering me but just about random shit. i called a suicide hotline and talked to that girl for a bit. nothing helped. i was going to go through with it. i got a 750 of jack, took it to my jobs parking garage at 2am, parked on the 2nd highest level and drank the entire bottle. i dont remember why i didnt do it, i dont remember anything from that night other than crying in my car untill i fell asleep. woke up the next morning and drove home. . . id already quit my job, so i decided to move back to san antonio with my mom, almost 30 years old and moving back in with my mom. terrible terrible feeling. i feel like i failed as an adult. got a job at a fast food joint. (naturally) and resumed life as the piece of shit that i am. i tried to pretend i was better off without her. the few friends that i have told me that i was better off, and that she was crazy anyways. she cheated on me and it was for the better that i wasn't with someone like her. i still love her though, if i ever heard from her again i.. i dont know how id react. i always tell myself that i would push her away, but i know i couldnt do that. it was easy for her because of the person that i am, but she was everything to me even though i was bad at showing it. . . my mom always tried to push me away from taking medication for my depression because of her bad experiences with antidepressants. not that i could afford it anyways. (im on the old american health plan of dont get sick because insurance is expensive.) i am so depressed, i have absolutely no motivation for anything. i felt like getting another girlfriend would help me, because deep down i know i am a dependent person. i just want to feel loved. i want to be loved and ive heard the cliche enough times that it makes me sick ""love yourself, no one can love you if you dont love yourself."" what is there to love? nothing. . . i am disgustingly unattractive. even when i was with my ex i knew she wasnt attracted to me at all, it came out when she cheated on me the first time. im fat, balding and disgustingly pale. im literally 300lbs of bird shit. i tried tinder for a bit, but that just dashed my confidence even more. i swipe right on every person i come across, trying just to see if anyone is interested. ive gotten 3 matches in the past 3 months and not one of them spoke to me before unmatching. i tried talking to them talked about interest i saw on their profiles, but nothing. . . i tried working out, but do you know how terrible it feels walking into the gym seeing all of these attractive, healthy people and then looking in the mirror at yourself? needless to say that didnt last long. i cant ever stick through with anything because i am so insecure and so depressed that i would rather just give up. all of the fast food jobs ive worked have gotten me so fat that i dont ever see myself being thin again.. . so that's what im going to do, what is the point of living when you are this unhappy? ive read around and i see the people posting ""dont give up we care about you!"" or the classic ""things will get better if you out the work in."" but i have no motivation or hope for my future. i am ready to die. . . . if you read this, just really consider the choices you make in life. i made a lot of bad ones, and this is what happens.",suicide

I just feel so stupid for being sad,insecure and melancholic when people have problems way worse than me like fuck off you useless cunt take your life already and don't be the reason why someone more deserving reason for not getting an opportunity or that girl you love so much who loves you back don't be the reason for making her life bad and sad because of you.. . I just want to live,grow stronger have new experiences be the fucking nonchalant dude I was but feel I'll never get the opportunity to do so again it's just work hard in college&gt;get degrees&gt;get job.. While not finding your actual purpose.. . Finally to end this stupid rant I've made a decision I'll take my life in November 2022 if I'm still the same dude I should have 0 reason for live and just take it already because by then I would have successfully disappointed everyone around me and no one would care about me.. . I'll just leave this up for a day I'm sorry you even had to read 5 words of this.I hope you all get what you really want or deserve",suicide
"How can I escape pain?I feel like I’m always enduring pain. This isn’t fair. I’m not okay.. . I’m so alone. I hurt so much. I’m inadequate and worthless in every respect/way. I’m doing awful in my school and learning Spanish. All that I have brought to other people is stress, pain, and suffering because I just burden them.. . I don’t understand how people live. I don’t understand how they endure the agony. I don’t know. Why am I even alive? There’s no purpose. I’m depressed, hopeless, and lonely.. . I hurt.. . I feel angry, bitter, and jealous, too.

"The World Is Going To Shit, And Memepages Aren't Helping This memepage on instagram I followed posted a meme abt the at&amp;t girl (you might know it) and a comparison of her in the commercial and her in real life.

Then I 1). get like 20+ simp replies because... duh... and 2.) The memepage admin replied back ""No."". . So that's bullshit but I don't really care...

And ofcourse I'm the whiny guy with my comment copied word for word underneath him. And he's the ""king character"" who simply says ""No."".

"I attempted suicidefew days ago I attempted suicide and my biggest wish is that I didn't survived. Is so painful to live in this constant state of thinking and hearing voices and telling them to shut the fuck up, I hate so much the feeling of being alive and can't describe the hell it's going on inside me and how this have been killing me for years.. . Even after this event I feel like nothing changed, nothing. I keep putting a smile in my disgusting face and cracking stupid and unfunny jokes all the time which only my Mom ""laughs"", I don't know what to think anymore, I don't know what to feel anymore sometimes I just want to cry but I can't, I simply can't and it hurts so badly, sometimes I just want the people I love around but it seems it's all going to hell. It seems I never learn, it seems I stay at the same place everytime and nothing changes, my vision about people and this whole world never changes and it will never will. I feel so disgusted in being alive and being me, for being so useless, for giving too much of myself. . . Maybe in the future, when I'm older and when I truly understand the pain of being alive I'll attempt it again but I will make sure that this time works. Maybe all the pain I've gone through as a kid, all the violence towards woman, all the bully, all the bad influence, all the fights, all the begging for helps ain't nothing. Maybe I'm just another 16 years old who thinks that knows shit when doesn't.. . . I'm sorry if there's any misspelling or gramatical errors.

I was a very bad person to all of them, all my family, my girlfriend. My new therapist doesn’t even listen to me. All I get from her is “yeah that’s tough” or “yeah must be hard”.

"Please make it all go away.I hate myself. Everything about me. But if you met someone who knew me, they would tell you so many good things about me and paint me so kindly. But I can tell you that that person hasn't seen me as you see me right now, boring, whiny, pathetic and with a serious lack of drive. Maybe more things that I can't think of, I don't know. I can never and will never let anyone see this part of me, I want them to be happy and have a good time and I will do my best to give it to them while I am with them.

And I can't put on a mask nor do I want to, faking it so you can make it is exhausting, I would rather be alone if I had a choice. But when I'm alone I can't contribute- it just doesn't end.. . Everything seems pointless. Why am I alive? A waste of space and air who no one should bother helping?. Yeah, I'm nice and I am not unkind. I have my morals and I care for people. They like me for a reason. I am fully capable of being an asset and changing things I'm passionate about for the better, and I have. Sure, I have my flaws but nothing is unfixable.  But what good is any of that if I am too depressed to put my good qualities to good use or to fix my bad sides? What good am I? I'm worthless, nothing good will come out of me living and everything is shit anyway. I don't need to tell you why life on earth is difficult. I guess my main reason for my distaste is how everything is just a problem after another. Who wants to go through that? I certainly don't. Having my own shit together would make it a heck of a lot easier but I don't have even that. I want to make things better for other people but I can't when I'm under water myself. . . I'm thinking about ending it, but I don't want to. I know that once I've decided, it is all over. I won't fail. I know I won't.. . I just want someone to tell me it's all going to be okay because it's so hard to believe it when I say it to myself. I've been saying it for years now and having my hopes crushed at every turn, I'm just tired. . . Please, tell me everything will be okay. Tell me that this is going to go away. I don't know if it's even possible at this point but is there any way for me to not hate myself so much? Everyone is their biggest self critic but I think mine can make anyone want to kill themselves. You have no idea. Everything I do is bad, even the good things. Everything is negative. . It is so draining and almost crippling to have that voice breaking you down. I truly believe everything will be okay if it was gone. But if this is how things are going to be I'd honestly just rather die.. . I can't get therapy, I can't get medication, I only have myself. I will not speak to anyone I know about this, I am just not comfortable with it and I will never be. I just want this part of me gone. I can't keep living like this. It's self sabotage. Why am I doing this to myself and hurting my future as well as others?. Ignoring it is extremely difficult if not impossible, countering it with positivity is impossible because it can break down anything. It has broken me down too.. .

Want to dieIt’s just really weird how everything’s happening for me. I’ve hated my life ever since I was young and I still want to die more than ever for the past year or two. Haven’t had one glimpse of hope or positivity in the past two years. All it’s been for me is just emptiness and I don’t even care anymore. I just hate so many things and I don’t enjoy one single activity. I never understood how I got here or why. It’s just like I was born to be this way. I always wanted to do good things but I’ve just never been good enough at anything. I don’t even like anything I’m doing now but I don’t know how to change that or where to go. I don’t like anything so how can I find something that I like when I don’t feel any different about anything. I don’t feel any enjoyment for any single activity. I’m starting to fail my classes now.

"WonderingsI often wonder about how things will be after I’m gone. I wonder how people will react, how they will describe me. I wonder if they’ll bend the truth and say I was a lovely girl who was always cheerful and caring, or if they’ll be honest and say I was a lonely teen who was withdrawn a lot and probably could’ve gone so much further if only I’d tried a little harder. I wonder if any notifications will build up on my phone, if any followers will message me from any accounts because they noticed I haven’t been active for a while, I wonder if people will send me messages when I’m gone, hoping that I’m in a better place. I wonder if those people who are no longer my friends will pretend to care, pretend that they loved me and that my death is a shock to them. I wonder if they’ll just shrug indifferently instead and think ‘at least she was honest when she said that stuff’. I wonder if they’ll even find out straight away, if news will spread and their parents will tell them that they heard from a friend of a friend that I had finally done it, I wonder if their parents will tell them that they are sorry and comfort them.

I wonder if people will feel bad, I wonder if they’ll look back at all my cries for help and feel like they should’ve done, said something. I wonder if they’ll think I had it coming. I wonder how many people it’ll affect. I wonder how many people will begin to care after I’ve gone instead of trying to be the support to prevent it. . . I know that one day I’ll do it. I know that this world isn’t for me. I don’t fit in here. It may be in a couple of years time but I will go through with it. I know I will. I know that it’s what I want to do, what I have to.

"Im either gonna do it or run away. Im not even 16. I want to die.I can’t take it anymore. Not only do i feel guilt from some fucked up shit i did when i was 12-13-14 that no one knows about, and suffering from mental health, but my family make it even worse. All they do is call me useless, shout at me, treat me like shit, put me below everyone else and whenever i try argue it just gets worse. They just call me a spoilt brat and then proceed to treat me like even more shit. I fucking hate them. They say, oh you have your xbox and things like that, and yes i appreciate that, but no matter what i do to help or the work i do around the house, im still useless and just worth less than everyone else. I fucking hate my life and tbh i want to kill myself. Even worse its like they purposley go out of there way to make my life worse, they purposley do things that make me misrable and then proceed to call me intolerable and to shut the fuck up or ill be grounded. I fucking hate everything. I tried talking to them about my problems and all they do is call me draining and to grow the fuck up. I physically both deserve to die and want to. Clearly im barely of any value to anyone in my life and tbh everyone would be probably be happier if i was dead. I’d be happier if i was dead and why? Because i feel like im a terrible person and that my value means nothing. The world doesn’t need me. My family don’t need me. I don’t want me. This was never a thing when i was younger.

"I found my unfinished suicide noteThere was a point in my senior year in high school where I was extremely depressed.

I didn’t plan on killing myself then but I was close. . . Fast forward to recently; I had been doing much better, especially considering my first week of community college had went well. . . A few days ago I was rummaging through my backpack during class and I came across that unfinished suicide note. It took me a while to process but I regained focus and put it aside. . . Today...

Please help me just tell me I am not aloneI am only 15 and my psychologist has essentially diagnosed me with extreme paranoia I say essentially because she knows it’s related to a unknown underlying condition.

"He doesn’t love me anymoreMe and my partner have been going through some pretty tough shit recently. Huge amounts of debt, family disputes and then myself suffering with severe anxiety and depression. This has put a massive strain on our relationship and everything has finally come to a crumbling mess. . We’ve always had our up and downs with little arguments here and there with us both saying nasty things to each other and then apologising for the heat of the moment shit (which most couples have) but it’s just all got too much. . I moved in with him and his family just under a year ago and to be perfectly honest, it is a very unpleasant environment. The only part of that house that gave me any joy was my partner and the animals. Even then I hated how they treated their only boy and me. The result of this environment led to me developing horrendous panic attacks which meant I had to drop out of university and my self harm and suicidal thoughts had gone through the roof. . Recently we had a really bad argument where I pretty much later down the line and told him what I needed to do. I told him I had to get out of that house so that I could sort out my issues and be a better person for both him and myself. And he needed to do the same. His job is dead end, he doesn’t have much in further education and is stuck in a rut with all these debts piling around him. How can we help each other if we can’t help ourselves you know? I want the best for the both of us but we need to be in a better place ourselves before we can even consider taking on someone else. . I thought that me moving out and giving each other some space to sort ourselves out would work really well. He is yet to make a decision.. The first thing that backfired is that he can’t deal with long distance. Neither could I because I’m very clingy but I’m not even a 20 min drive away. So I felt that wouldn’t be an issue but clearly it is.. Secondly, I’m trying to stay in contact with him while he makes his decision but he says that he struggles to talk to me because it makes him so upset. If I make him that upset then why is he still considering being with me? . Lastly, I always message him morning and night saying good morning/night and asking how he is because I still love the bloke to pieces and want to make sure that he’s ok. I always say I love him because it’s the truth but he just can’t message it back and it’s KILLING me. . I know we decided to not see each other and give each other a bit of space while things were quite raw so that we can think properly but it’s obviously not helping. I CANNOT wait any longer for his decision. It’s only been a couple of days but my mind is going into overdrive and I just want it all to stop!!!! . I love him so fucking much and he is the only thing bringing any happiness into my life! I’m so fucking lonely and I love him so much! If he had given me an answer and day or two ago then I would have been able to take it but the fact that I’m sat here waiting for a response, holding onto a glimmer of hope, it’s destroying me. I just want to know whether I can move on with my life or not. Or whether the liquid morphine in the house will knock me out for good without having to wake up and be looked after by a carer. . I am so fucking stupid for even considering being apart. I’m so fucking stupid for moving out. I’m so stupid for ruining our relationship!!! But I need to help myself and he needs to help himself so how do I win?!. I think if he leaves then that will be the end of me. My last piece of hope and happiness in my life will be gone. I’m even contemplating saying my goodbyes now. I just can’t fight anymore. I’m not a strong person and I can’t do it anymore. Im not meant to be in this world. ",suicide

"Got in an incredibly minor car accident, but afraid of consequencesUh.... . Long story short, I pulled a hit and run on somebody after panicking. After we had pulled over. Like a dick.

It's worth noting that it didn't look like I did any damage to his car, though I only saw it from an angle and from afar.. . .

"What if the future isn't better?The last day of highschool for me is tomorrow. . . &amp;#x200B;. . I've still got exams but classes are done forever. . . &amp;#x200B;. . I've been looking forward to this day pretty much since I started highschool 6 years ago. Because right from the start I hated it, and I don't know if there's any correlation but the start of highschool was also the time when my mental health got really bad and I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I mean, I'm sure it wasn't all because of school, I can't speak about my mental health (mostly because I don't remember) but I've had pretty strong thoughts about running away since I was like 7 or 8. . . &amp;#x200B;. . I should be happy and in some ways I am. This is possibly the big turning point for me. I can study something I'm interested in for university, I can wake up each day excited at the days possibilities. I can get a job and use the income to gain a bit of independence from my family and although it would probably take a few more years I could eventually move out (my family and my interactions with them are a frequent initiator for thoughts of suicide and depression). . . &amp;#x200B;. . But now I'm just thinking about what everyone is saying and what I've heard repeated by adults. That this (highschool) is the best time of our lives and that the outside world is horrible. People saying that its a sad thing for me to leave highschool because university is going to be worse. My dad saying that my future boss will yell at me daily even worse then what he does to me. Multiple people saying that having a job sucks. I'm just having so much doubt that things are gonna change for the better. University is pretty much the same as high school. And yeah I'll be studying something I ""enjoy"" but like i have barely lived and i have no idea if it is something that i truely enjoy. . . &amp;#x200B;. . And then with all this doubt of the future being better than the present i just get depressed and think of suicide. Because why keep living if the future is going to be worse? The fear of death is always a big factor stopping suicide but throughout my life I've also had the possibility that things will get better. But if life after highschool is apparently so shit then why live? I am literally just prolonging the pain. If i die now then that sucks but at least i won't have to live another like year or two years in constant pain.",suicide

"I don't care to live.I was raised by a monster. He killed himself and I never expected to live that long. I expected him to finally lose his sense of reality entirely and just kill us. Telling someone never occurred to me. I grew up being raised into some form of stockholm syndrome. Him threatening to kill us all (me, my mother, my sister, anyone blood related basically.) I don't know what comfortable is. I grew up in fear. I went to sleep every night with a knife in my hands. Expecting him to kick in the door and start screaming and beating on me. I should of called the cops. But fear left me paralyzed most of the time. After I graduated he shot himself. I felt nothing when I found the body. That was a year ago. Nothing's changed really. I'm still afraid all the time. I've spent my entire life being terrified. It's stuck on me. I grew up in what most people describe as a war zone. My kind mother fighting my father, a sick twisted psychopath who enjoyed making others feel less than human, and watching them suffer and humiliating them, screaming horrible things that never made sense. It was terrifying. He reduced us to less than human. The worst stories you've read about how cruel one person can be to another was everyday of my life. Like we we're his personal slaves. I don't recall much of what was said. It's just him screaming at the top of his lungs whatever sick thing he could think of. Incest. Rape. Racism. Murder. Screaming at my 4 yr old sister that she's a dirty fucking whore nigger. Whatever he could say to make you wish you were dead. There was no reason, if he got angry about anything suddenly we were his metaphorical punching bags. My mother doesn't understand how dead inside I am. For her that was a bad chapter in her life. Me? That's how I was raised. To feel nothing. To be empty. But fear or hate. I don't want to go on anymore. Even getting stoned doesn't help. I don't know what it is to feel anything else.

"I don't know how to continue...I'm 20, for the last 10 years I have been dealing with depression,  as well as some anxiety and insomnia. I have spent most of my life without friends, they would often notice how depressed I am and make fun of me or just leave me. About a year ago to may of this year I have been less depressed as I found my first girlfriend, she helped me through the suicide of my uncle back in February and a death of another uncle at the end of April. She made me happy even though it was long distance and it was hard. At the beginning of may she broke up with me, my depression kicked in again hard and over the weekend she told me she never wants to talk to me again, I love her, probably the only person I truly love in this world besides the uncle who committed suicide. I don't know what to do. I feel so lost, alone, and much more depressed that I ever have been in the past. In the last 10 years I've probably attempted suicide once every 2-6 months and in the last 3 months I have been taken to the hospital and had a couple failed attempts.

"✌️Since I have nobody to talk to I might as well talk to myself. All I wanted was to have a family but I failed. Just like everything else I’ve attempted in my life. Failure after failure. Tragedy after tragedy.  Disappointment after disappointment. I haven’t looked in the mirror in a few days because I genuinely hate myself. I hate myself for who I am. I hate myself for not getting help before l ruined my life and Hailey’s life. I hate myself because I’m not going to be there everyday to see my beautiful daughter. It doesn’t matter what meds the doctors put me on. I’m sick. I’m unfixable. I’m broken. The amount of sadness and depression that I have in me can not be medicated. It can’t be talked about to any “professional”. I’ve held onto these feelings for so long that it has became a part of who I am. I don’t want to leave this world. I want to be here for my family. I want to see my daughter get on the school bus for her first day of school. I want to see my siblings graduate high school. I want to see my friends succeed and live life instead of just existing. And I realized All of these things can be done without me being here. I don’t want anyone to be sad when I go. I want people to be happy. I want people to be relieved. I’m a cancer to everyone I meet and don’t even realize the damage I create until it’s done. I’m tired of being a burden to everyone. I’m tired of disappointing everyone. I’m tired of being me and I know everyone is tired of me too. I wouldn’t call my death a “suicide”. That’s a harsh word. This is more of a “sacrifice” for peace. Something that I was NEVER able to provide to anyone EVER in my life. Hailey I will always love you. You were nothing but good to me. Please don’t let my death upset you. The time we were together was the best years of my life, but the worst for you. I’m sorry for everything that I put you through.  To my daughter... I don’t want to go but Daddy is really sick. I’m not going to get better. I don’t want you growing up hating me because of my sickness. I also don’t want you to hate me because I took myself out. I’m in a lot of pain. The pain is only going to grow as you get older. When you were born I made it my goal to be there everyday and night for you. That’s no longer an option. I will be with you in spirit everywhere you go. Daddy will always be there... My parents... I’m sorry for underachieving and not being the son you wanted. To all my friends, a lot of you have come and gone. A lot of us grew apart. I’m sorry you guys have to go through this but I’m in pain boys. I can only laugh and joke it off for so long before I eventually feel my feelings. I couldn’t have asked for any better friends than you guys.

"I didn't know I was pregnant until it was too late.Hello. I've been here before, in a much darker place, but not really willing to die. Now that I'm actually planning on killing myself, and the world seems ironically so much cheerier than it was then.  . . . I was a virgin until college. When I lost it, we tried to be as safe as possible, but it seems like I wasn't careful enough. I didn't catch the symptoms until it was too late. I have an ultrasound soon, which will be the determining factor on whether or not I have to kill myself.

I've been extremely fortunate in my life. I always felt like it was undeserved, and that I would fuck it up somehow. It's weirdly cathartic to be right.

"SUICIDE NOTE  . . I have been pondering over this question again and again why do we live. We live to make a difference, to make our lives better and to prosper. I have been thinking what I have achieved so far. I have achieved regrets, worthlessness, self-pity and remorse. I had not done a single right thing in my life but I am changing that right now. By ending my life, I am rectifying my 24 years of mistake. I am very happy to do this. This is the best decision ever I could take in my entire life (well, my life was very short!). Ending my life gives me the greatest pleasure ever. Reliving the pain daily hurt so much.. . I had many ambitions, too many desires and many more hope. I desired to reach the stars. But I have hit rock bottom in my life. I am just a wasted opportunity. I am deep in debt, got my injury in back and has a job I am afraid of the most. I do not want to live just want to end it all. I have been fighting severe depression for the past 1 year. No one really understood my changed behaviour (well, I cannot blame anyone as everyone has their own life to take care of) but I expected someone to help me. The end is near and I am at a loss of words to express myself. All my life I strived to be a better version of myself and I could not think I would die of hypoxia!  Let us discuss the reasons why I took such a severe step as a suicide note is supposed to do: (this is a general rant of things happening in my life, you could skip if you want). . 1. **Back Pain:**. . My first suicide attempt was when I got my back injury. I just wanted to end the physical pain then but was not well researched(silly me!). I thought of jumping in the open sea and thanks to God, I did not do it. It would have been an agonising pain of 20 minutes.. . Well, the most important cause of my suicide is my back pain**.** Had it not been there, I had not lost hope and would have worked something like I always do. I tried treating it at various facilities but with 0 success so far. I do not remember a single day I was not troubled by this pain for the past 2 years. The driving factor and the motivation for my suicide is my back pain.. . 2. **Financial Condition:**. . I belong to a family where you can only afford one chance to succeed. There is no retake, no revised script and no new cast! I am dirt poor, had been since my dad retired. He has been dead for a year now and I have been struggling to make ends meet. From my college days, I became independent financially due to the undeserved scholarships I got. But I miss my father. Maybe after I got injured, if my family had some money, I would have been treated better, maybe I would have an alternate career trajectory. Maybe I would have committed suicide in that scenario also but definitely not now. So money became the immediate reason of my suicide. I am bankrupt and I know my family cannot even afford my last rites.. . 3. **Education Loan:**. . Had I not been in such debts, I would not have blinked an eye and would have thought of something. The education loan is the ticking time bomb in my situation. It actually gave a time frame that I have to die before this time to never face the huge debts.. . 4. **My relationships :**. . I never had a successful relationships. I tried so hard but maybe I am not the type. I have some major personality flaws and I always accepted that but the other party never really understood that. I do not blame anyone for my suicide but this is the part where they could have saved me. Nobody really tried, telling a depressed man everything is going to be all right is never going to cut it. He has already lost hope and there is no chance he will listen to your blabber. There is no man up and face the situation, he had already accepted he lost the battle. The only way to revive him is get him to an infirmary and treat him like a patient. At least give him some love. I never got any love from my loved ones when I told them I am struggling in my life. They all told me I have to face this alone but I cannot do it alone. It is impossible for me to face the difficulties if I could not face myself. The list includes all my family members , friends and my loved ones who could have saved me if they would just listen and not give any advice. I never needed any. But I do not blame them. I know everyone is struggling in these troubled times and this decision is mine only. I have not taken it under any duress. It is just a planned attempt. I tried telling everything to various person but they never listened. I thank one person who was always there for me thick and thin. He or She(I have left it to your wild imagination) always stood by my side and was always there. Thank you my friend, I will always be indebted to you.. . .**TL,DR**  I got a physical injury which I never recovered, am in a very bad financial situation, too much debts and failed relationships. This is the short version why I am committing suicide.",suicide

Advice is appreciated.. thank you..  .  so recently (well i geuss the past 4 years) ive been having extremely bad mental breakdowns, and theyve gotten more frequent and worse as of last year.  As a bit of clarity to what im experiencing i need to back a few years. Back in middle school i was not in a safe place.

And  everything hit really hard for me, a friend had turned on me, i lost many to death, and honestly i felt like i was about to lose it. I was constantly bottling everything up and crying because i couldnt handle it. I was nearly driven to the point of suicide.. and even more recently i lost more family, and lost and entire group of friends, and nearly lost one to suicide. At this point im constantly stressed, im driven by anxiety and i cant even talk to my own mother about these because i know shell blame it on how much i socialize. Wich.. at this point is the only thing keeping me together. And now i constantly feel like im going to break down into tears and almost concidered suicide again.. and its causing more of these panic attacks, flashing these parts of my life that i want to forget but i cant..ive been shoving everything down because im scared of opening up to my family. I dont feel comfortable at all and im scared.

I don't consider myself an alcoholic, but other people would look at my tendencies and say I am:  I drink when I wake up, I drink when I (got) home from work...I drink to make myself stupid.

If I honour her wish and don't call anyone, and she ends up dead, I'll hate myself for the of my life. I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place and don't know what to do, if there's even anything I can do. I've pretty much made up my mind of not calling anyone and honouring her wishes, but I feel helpless and don't know what to do anymore. even just some distractions are appreciated.",suicide

"I’m feeling :) It feels good to be happy. I’m diagnosed w depression and it SUCKS, but yeah I have passed through a rly depressing past couple of weeks and I’m feeling good again!! It gets hard dudes, it rly does. I even thought of going back to suicidal thoughts. It was not a good mindset at all. But now I’m feeling good, my mood is up! I’m going to work hard in school (it’s my second week back). I’m feeling really good at the gym. Everything is looking good. Hopefully this feeling lasts my boys:)",non-suicide
"I might be a psychopath, but— You ever think about just randomly killing someone? Like, in any possible method, stabbing, strangling, drowning, etc etc. like, you just want to know how it feels and see the life of another person vanish as their body gets cold. Like, just that feeling of sometimes wanting to stab someone or slice their head off, or just, something. I dunno.",non-suicide
"At this point I'm just happy to have moments of mental reliefs before I kill myself.I can't say what it is, but I've been going through a lot of mental pain and suffering for the last week or two. I haven't been able to rest at all, I haven't been able to seriously focus on anything and I could barely think. Most of my mind was occupied with fighting intrusive thoughts and letting them pass, contrary to belief, made everything so much worse... . Now I am feeling better and I am just thankful that I had this small relief before I kill myself.",suicide
"Story time: the most frightening moment of my life Ok this is going to sound ridiculous but this came from a farm goat. We were visiting my dad’s farm and when we were getting back in the car to go home my dad said that we were bringing a goat along and that it had to sit NEXT TO ME. Next thing you know I was sitting next to the goat in the back seat of my parents car and it was TERRIBLE. The goat was screaming and kicking around and I was scared for my life. My dad kept insisting that I was safe but I certainly didn’t feel safe at all. I was at the point where I was crying like crazy and screaming to be let in the front seat.. . Eventually my mom convinced my dad to let me go away from the goat but it was still traumatizing. We are off to slaughter the goat now. BRB to write another post about me being traumatized, but this time about the slaughter.",non-suicide
"I have borderline personality disorder and my Favorite Person just abandoned me so now I wanna dieBPD stands for borderline personality disorder. In a nutshell, it's having unstable moods, emotions, self\-image, and behavior. There's an irrational fear of abandonment and frantic efforts to avoid it, unstable relationships, self\-harm, extreme emotional swings, suicidal ideation, chronic emptiness, explosive anger, and dissociation.. . A lot of people with BPD have what you call a Favorite Person. A Favorite Person is the one we seek validation from the most, fear abandonment from the most, and want to spend time with the most. . . Anyway, my FP is a guy I met through Reddit so he lives oceans away. He stopped talking to me a few days ago and blocked me everywhere because I am such a piece of shit. I've tried everything to stop him from abandoning me but he did it anyway. So now I wanna die but not really. I mean, I just want to end the pain but I have so much to live for. I got into my dream university, I have two cute doggos who love me so much, I have loving friends and family, I'm going to be an actress and a musician, etc. When I think about it, I do have a really good life. But IDK, I just want to end the pain. It hurts so much. I've been trying to cope by flirting with a lot of people \(mostly boys who only want one thing, which reminds me of that meme\) and drinking heavily and dissociating and hurting myself, but I still feel like shit and I want to die. I don't know what to do anymore. I just want to jump out of the window. Right now. Please help me. I don't know. I don't know.",suicide

"I don't know if I should post this here, I feel like i have to step out of this world, I won't only not to hurt my family. A read will help a lot, sorry if this triggers someone.I'm a 22 M, not from the US, don't know if I should post this. . First I'll address the bad things I've done and tell my porn problems not to soften it,  I'll tell my life trauma after. . I've commited sexual misconducts, whatever it is called I committed sexual crimes.When I was 18 in college freshman year I was like the cute kid that acted very childish and never acted  wrong to anybody but I was really sick in the mind without knowing,never did sum wrong before that. When I was a freshman in college I went to a party in a friends house, I started trying to kiss her, like I wanted to make up with her even being kinda friends,I was really drunk, dropping glasses with alcohol and shit, and she just avoided me and I guess she was like ""wtf is wrong with him"" and than i kept persisting and moments after she left to go other place I went there and waited for her to come off the bathroom and straight up locked her with me in the bathroom,she kissed me laughing and then left,after I peed in that bathroom i went to the dancing place and sat grabbing my head, and told her  did I bother you too much? I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, and she got that I was wrong and we kinda  hugged each other and it just got never spoken too much after, and my friends of that time just laughed at the situation, I guess they couldn't tell that I was sick. Sometimes that year  I kept insisting with girls to make up, it wasn't really bad to me to think of that in a flirty way because I was being mostly a jerk, not an absolute sick fuck like in that locking situation.But I couldnt control my ego I think or whatever it was, specially when drunk ur high. . . 2 years after this when i was 20 I think I started to become absolutely sick, when I was working in a supermarket as a sales men I saw an adult women with a big butt and took a photo of her, I don't know why, but when I went home I deleted them thinking like wtf am I doing, and I remember when i was in 7th grade there was a week where me and my friends  used to do that with teachers, and my sister told me that time "" you're so dumb"" , and I stopped and always hated people that did that, even when high school friends came with pictures they had took from women on the subway and shit I was like, this is bad guys, because I had realized it years before and somehow I ended up doing that again.. .  This same year I went to a party with a friend of mine and girlfriends, I made up with a classmate , and she made up with my friend and even her friends, we were  really drunk and she was more drunk than us, we started to make up and after I realizing she was buzzed I stopped, and we made up again  in the same party like 3 hours after that bc I thought she was better, and this might be the first moment when my absolutely misconstrued idea of sexual things I viewed in porn came off, we were dancing really close and I put her hand in my groin, not under clothes but in my groin, she took her hand off and like a minute after she just put my hands on her breast, we just made up and that's it, I don't think this was that bad bc we were all drunk and something was made to me too but still I hadn't realized I had absolutely no education about sexual behaviour at all. . . This same year, in a party in April I was trying to get to make up with this same girl because I had always liked her, it didn't work out and as usually she just played with me and made me feel bad just for fun. . Then I just got mad and felt ashamed, and when I calmed I went to this girl I had found attractive and I knew she liked me since last year and nothing happened that year, we were talking, we agreed to go make up and went to a tent that was alone, we talked about things and we had a good time, if I tried to touch a boob or something she said no and I stopped, that's it, it felt awkward and didn't persist, i did try to make her stay  there because it was a nice moment but she left so we weren't discovered as it had been secret I guess, and like 2 hours after  I made up with this girl, friend of the girlfriend of a friend. I think I drank tequila shots before  to make myself bolder (extremely dangerous) and we started making up and . I was way too persistent to go somewhere else to go a step beyond, I tried too much to touch her tho she had told me no more then one time, I put her hand in my groin too, second time I did that, I wasn't controlling myself even when there was people there trying to sleep or making up on their side too, I don't know if being alone before made me think that I was going to scare the other girl or I was just sober or I don't know but the second  time I was too persistent, she had to take my hands off her some times and after I just kinda realized, calmed myself or Idk, we kept making up and talking things until the morning, even when we woke up so  I didn't take it as a bad situation because we had kept kissing, but in general I acted terrible and at this point I just had stopped apologizing for the shit I did, and now that I woke up from all this shit I may know why I didn't worry anymore and I will tell about it, if someone really accepts to  read this because I know it will disgust most people and it doesn't get me mad or sum, it's obvious. We had each other in social media for all this time and it didn't seem that it was that bad bc this friend always told me I liked her, so I guessed it wasn't that bad, This year, 2 years after there were lots of people getting canceled on the me too movement, and I said to myself ""I will apologize to her after all this calms"" and that's where I hit a switch and say hell no, if I have to be exposed I'll accept it bc I'm not a coward, so I sent her a long text asking how she felt on the situation,that I deadass persisted too much and that I a was to desperate and I told her that I was having suicidal thoughts, that I live with an abusive brother and that I had been bullied at school, and as I was put thru so much violence I was scared that if I would've had a GF I would've been a jackass, and I was scared that I could explode in violence (none of this is a lie, I was just realizing my life had been an absolute shitload of trauma) . And well she told me that yeah I was too persistent and she had to take my hands off her, and she was in surprise of that message because she kinda didn't remember the situation, she told me that when she felt abused by men it was in other situations and she thought of the thing with me as a drunk party type thing, that she respected that I was admitting things and that I had to get help, and I thanked her really for listening to me, and she gave me help and advice , I couldn't be more thankful to her. . . When I apologized to her I told her I had harassed her, and in reality it was abuse,or assault, not harassment at all, I went to read laws about it and the world just fell down to me, I honestly didn't know that was abuse and if I had known I would've reported myself, but I didn't know shit about consent or anything, tho I knew when to stop as a I had done that same day, it's crazy to me, when I started to connecting this,that I acted extremely different at moments, I started to realize I was sick, and being miseducated didn't help at all. . . 1 month after that thing in 2018  i was in other party, everything good and fine until I started dancing with one girl and we were really close to each other, and after minutes of dancing with her I tried to kiss her, she said no, then I started to get her far from people, again thinking that creep ass shit could work, I guess if I just told her like what if we go other place? Would've been better if I said that , and I got her to other place and tried to kiss her repeatedly,thinking I was flirting,thinking it was playful, I don't know why, I think I wasn't that drunk at this time but I couldn't realize that I was acting extremely weird. After being persistent she got tired of me and left, day after I didn't apologize,is like at this time I have given in to sickness, as I will explain below. And basically a few days later a friend of mine called me saying that she wanted to accuse me of harassment , but she wanted to talk with me, no by phone or something, in person and I was like OK sure,my friend set a meeting and we met like a Friday at 5 pm to talk about this, they let us talk and she told me that lots of people were saying that she made up with everyone n shit and she thought it was me that was saying that , I told her I wasn't telling anything, that that ish shouldn't have happened at all in a was just acting dumb and drunk, I don't know if I was really cause it happened a long time ago so I can't remember but I think I wasn't that drunk, is just  that somehow I was used to do weird ish at this point, don't fkn know why. At this point I was screwed up, 2 months  after this I quit basketball because of feeling I was trash and didn't feek self esteem at all, and I started my first heavy depressive phase, I kept going to parties that year and never got into  anything with anybody, I was too scared to be persistent again and I never wanted to bother anybody. . . But in halloween of this year (2018) I went to a party with my friends, and this girl that I had trouble with, the one that made up with my friend, with me, the one that always played with me, I got into this party and as soon as she arrived, she just told me wth I was doing there, like she just arrived and started trying to make me angry, she and her friend, all day whenever I said something they were like, ""no you don't say anything"", whenever I put a song on the party playlist, they removed it, they were isolating me from my friends and my friends(lame ass friends) weren't doing anything and I just got drunk as hell,had left my dog alone at home, had spent time and money to go to that party and they were isolating me so I got drunk just to be there without thinking. I connected this too because alcohol really hits me and make me get all my problems  out, basically I got drunk as hell and i lost conscious, I remember just to some point, and when I woke up I was laying on the floor with vomit in my clothes, and a friend telling me that I shouldn't treat people like that, I guess I told this girl that she was a b1tch or sum, honestly I think she deserved it but anyway I acted terrible, and honestly I don't remember this, I just remember waking up and seeing my ""friends"" laughing at me with these girls, and the friend that was trying to make me stop and threatening to kick me out, was a friend that I had always taken care of,if it wasn't for me he could've died from alcohol poisoning, so I felt betrayed and just went full defensive mode, I didn't talk to them or this girl or days and just returned to talk with them, but honestly I was going full shell mode. . . Next year(2019) I was fucked up, didn't talk to more than 2 people at school and I was just a jerk, I was just a depressed fuck, at some point I said to myself : why the hell am I so lonely? And I couldn't do anything, I just started pressuring my best friend to spend time with me without knowing, I was just sick in the head. Went partying a few times and moderated my drinking but I hadn't solved anything, at half of the year I went to the club and started dancing with a girl and did that hand thing again, Im so sure I watched this ish from porn, and that time it ""worked"" because he started grabbing me and we were touching each other above the clothes and all, but my way to approach people was still wrong as shit. This same year i went to other party and when we were leaving I was leaving with these girls that kinda  flirted with me(and made me uncomfortable) lots of times and I just drank pure alcohol to be bolder(dangerous decision, again)thinking that I didn't like her but I needed to make up with someone, I was isolating myself at abnormal levels and I went with her to the subway, I didn't know where I was going and I was getting more drunk, we got alone and we started kissing and we were making up in the subway train with people watching, and there I put her hand in my groin under the clothes (if reading these things makes someone  mad, just tell me I'm a piece of ish or don't help me at all, I know this type of ish isn ok at all), but again it ""worked"" because we starting making up and touching each other, we were horny as hell in the subway in a Friday night, I guess people were just looking at us like what the hell is happening, and then I told her we should have sex and she replied when and we kept talking like that and I got persistent to go somewhere else, I was desperate to have any interaction with someone, for real I wanted to stop living from a year ago, and I couldn't realize a I was in extremely need of help, then we just separated and I realized that I was going to anywhere just to make up with her, i was buzzed, barely could walk and I just left, I felt nauseous and I didn't realize I had to come back home , I just had drank from the bottle to be bolder, I won't ever drink fucking alcohol again and below I'll explain my problems with drinking too. I haven't apologized to this girl, mainly because it was consensual I feel, but if Im able to I will tell her sorry for doing that ish, not to not get exposed on IG or some, just because I acted like a creep and I had to say sorry for my behaviour, and I'll ask her how she feels or something. Just because I'm trying to do better in life. . . When I entered college and throughtout my life I took care of lots of girls for them not to be abused or harassed, I've been congratulated lots of times and I've been told thanks for taking care, for dancing with them to get the creepsters out, even at my first big party I took a friend out of a car when a guy was taking her there,she was absolutely drunk and buzzed, honestly people even clapped their hands looking at me for being such a good guy, but when it came to me,I couldn't controll myself at times and I had an absolutely fucked view of sexual intercourse until I realized it. To this day, I don't know how I got to be like that, I don't know what lead to me to it, I felt tho I had bad view on sex still I didn't persist when it felt  awkward, and most of my classmates knew me as the dumb guy that didn't take the chances to do something with a girl. And my mental issues and alcohol issues contributed, I don't feel shame when saying I fell to sickness. That's how gross those parties were, wont say too much but I got harassed, got my ass grabbed and I was molested more then 15 times in school, even got my butt grabbed in a normal day of class by a group of girls, and everytime even my girlfriends laughed at this, saying I was lying or that I wasn't that cute to get harassed. That's how people were there and now that conceptions had changed everyone denies acting like that.. . Now I'll explain my problems, will try not to write that much not to be boring . . My porn problems were huge,i started watching at eleven years old, I got addicted to it from 12-13 and I watched mostly everyday until 22 years old,there was days where I didn't, because days were too busy or I didn't want to but it was an everyday thing, I had a gf at 12,we saw each other 2 times than she just dumped me and made fun of me for a whole year, i never got any interaction with women after that until I got to college where I was about to be 18 years old. All this time I watched porn, 2, 3 times or even 5 or more times a day, sometimes 1, some times 2, I remember being every day saying some times, what the hell am I watching, I watched most type of porn without knowing what I was learning from that, I watched bus harassement type videos, Asian videos which are the worst ish I think, in general industry porn which is just unreal, penetrating people outta nowhere, girls randomly wanting to do things to you, and in general in porn man persist until things happen. I've been battling with perverted thoughts since I am a kid, whenever I was in a bus I had intrusive thoughts (we all do) and it seemed like they happened to me often, I never did anything to anybody at a train or something  because of me being anxious, I had a compulsive mind without knowing that it made me erase some of the ish I thought, whenever a girl put her body on me at a train or sum (happened a lot) I just stepped  back really nervous trying not to make anyone uncomfortable,I had these dumb fantasies or urges like with cousins, teachers, old women and I honestly at some point thought like I was irresistible to women, and I didn't manifest anything because somehow I preserved my consciousness, like wtf I was just a 12 yo kid,and always ended up falling  into porn, stopped some times but I never got out of it, I was addicted to it since a kid. . . My childhood was tragic, we were poor and my mother died when I was 6 years old due to aneurysm, I have 3 or 4 flashbacks of her but nothing more. I was bullied in most schools in middle school, when I was 8 I was bullied a whole year, got my school stuff broken a lot and I didn't even know why I got bad grades, got my foot broken by a classmate that wanted to make me fall, and I had to walk limping for a month until I cried that I couldn't walk anymore, same time i sat next to a classmate that grabbed and touch my balls/groin daily, idk if it was for a week or a month but it was for some time,and it stopped when I told my dad crying that I had done the same  to him, he went to the school to make this stop but school didn't do ish.I had lots of moments stuck in my head, like when I got intimidaded of groups of kids, when everyone laughed at me daily, when a kid threw a pen and the top of it made a hole in my face,and there's more of  all this, I remember it and I don't know why I do. . Same time as this I was starting to suffer violence from my older brother, which is 9 years older, he  was already dumb and kinda crazy, he suffered epileptic attacks when he was a kid and from there he became violent, and he just lost it when our mom died, it was when he was about to be 15 yo. He cooked for me and my twin sister, he taught me things, he took care of us, he gave me good moments but he just ruined  my mind and was a bigger bully than everybody else. I remember hundreds of violence episodes with him, one time we were making a bed and I didn't put a cover the right way and he started yelling at me and then told me to cry, like putting the blame on me, one time we were playing in a Playstation and I made a mistake, and he shoved me and told me ""retire from everything related to soccer"" or some ish like that, he used  to hit me over little mistakes, being always aggressive as hell and projecting everything to me, there are probably dozens or houndreds of times he has hit me, and not at full force which I think was worse because it was mostly why I got used to it and why I never did anything, when I used to tell my dad, he would wait for him to leave and tell me that I was a coward for not fighting back, and I had to obviate all this, that's the form of  surviving  that I found, and I think that it fucked my life. . . To put it on perspective when I was 17-18 and he was 26, he came to my room to bug me, i kinda hit him in the forehead to take him off me, and he said ""oh OK mf"" or something like that, raised his  hand and if he doesn't think it twice he just knocks me out, if I don't cover myself he probably just knocks me out, and still hit me in my head twice, just not that hard. My sister came to see what happened and my brother  started saying: ""he's hitting me from the back"" , ""he's b1tch slapping"" , and I was like ""wtf, nobody did nothing to you"" and he told me ""ahh how do you say no motherfucker"" and kicked me in the stomach using all his strength while I was laying in my bed, if I don't cover myself, he just breaks something in my body, and that's how his mind has always worked, when he gets a Lil angry he starts saying uncommon ish, ish that didn't happen and ish that doesn't event fit the situation, and he has been like this always, just this year he started following me and ordering me ish and things when he got drunk. And in March he threatened me, said that I was sick and offered me a fight just because I told him that I don't like him. Last year in 2019 he hit  me with 2  full strength punches in my back, just because he got mad over me returning a slap in the back that he gave me, and he just told me that I should go to cry as always, that I'm sick, then he got nervous and started walking over the house and finally put his head on his gf shoulder and went to cry to his room, that's how he is and he's been always like that. . . Our grandmother was crazy too, he's a religious fiend that had preached for years and goes to his house and drowns newborn cats just not to raise them, she used to argue a lot with my brother and even once he told her ""you killed your mother, it's your fault"" in front of me and my sister when we were having lunch, we were like 8 years old. He tried to put religious ish in my mind and traumatized me sometimes even saying the cartoons that I watched were devilish and shit. We wouldn't let her tho because we knew she was sick, and honestly for the life she's suffered its normal, old people could get what I'm saying. . . I discovered a lot of sexual shit as a kid too, nude type games in cousins cellphones, porn cds in my brothers room, and I think even I discovered nude photos of my dad and his girlfriend when I was like 9, I just looked at them  and closed the flip phone, but I think it was too much exposure mixed with all the fucked  shit I went thru.I remember being like 9 and having sudden sexual thoughts sometimes, even when i felt no desire at all so I guess I just had  been mindfucked by life in general. . . I've always randomly doodled, always used to draw dark shit as a kid, eat like crazy since a young age. My father this year told me that at 8 years old I said i wanted to die to go with my mom. And this year I realized that I talk alone at all places, when I'm at the streets I start mumbling alone, and sometime my voice scapes and that's when I realize I'm talking alone, sometimes I've said hi and raise my hand to the air like imaging a friend of mine is there, at times i insult the air without realizing, whenever I remember all the things my brother did to me, I don't realize but I end up punching the air like if my mind was in other place, when I was younger I denied it when I got discovered, saying I was singing sending a voice message  or something . And that's how I felt when doing these things  to these girls and that's how I felt when I was dominated by impulse, I don't realize what I'm doing, I only thought of myself and I couldn't  get that wrong ideas out of my mind, and I'm learning to control it in a way. And Ive felt like a fight of voices in my head, but I guess that's kinda normal, anyway I'll go to therapy obviously. . . I started realizing all this when I was in my worst state ever in quarantine, all this got thru my head, all my wrong acts, well crimes, not like they are just mistakes(?, all that I had suffered started to connect in my mind and it had my head rolling over, I was walking in my house alone till 6 am, mumbling alone, trying to connect shit, trying to remember everything and not make excuses for nothing, just go to the root to know why the hell I am like this. . . Since that Halloween problem in 2018 I wanted to stop living, didn't even knew that I had done shit that was so wrong, and still wanted to suicide, I didn't trust anybody anymore, I felt betrayed and that I was always the rejected person, and honestly I was but as I said I just went full shell mode. I was acting and thinking suicidal for 2 years and even then I didn't think  I needed help. And that's what makes me sad at the end of all, I think my own mechanism to survive made me a sick mf, I think being brave to survive this childhood  fucked my life,if I had just shown signs fo sickness or if I would've been educated about sex I would have never done anything, my dad is a social worker and when I told him everything he said he was sorry, bc he knew I didn't have a mom, he knew I was being touched and bullied and he still didn't take me to a therapist thinking I was doing fine. Plus we were poor as hell, if someone had gone to therapy we wouldn't been able to eat or shit like that, I guess my dad thought he could control everything and I don't blame him, I can imagine the amount of pressure he had. . .  if I could apologize again or if I could apologize for something I haven't, I would, and if I had the chance to do so I will, I know im doing fine, I've been told that there's little to no people that can reflect from his trauma the way I do, I know that I won't ever do dumb shit again, I will go to therapy and I know it will work out but still I feel like my life is over in some aspects, I feel like I won't ever have a gf, because whenever I have one I won't be able to keep my secrets  to myself, and I will tell her everything and  I think most girls will run away from me, where I live recently there was a psychopath that apologized to her ex just to murder  her, and just yesterday a disappeared girl was found dead killed by a tinder date..  . And even tho is sad, I know  I can't complain, I'm still alive, and I should be in jail really, or I shouldve been exposed on social  media a long time ago. If I had to go to jail ill still would go, and i know seeking punishment doesn't make me better but I would still do it. . . I honestly feel like I'm a good person, I don't know how I preserve my consciousness and I don't know how I've overcame all this, I know bad things were done by me but I don't know I got to turn my life around having those mental issues that only made me defend myself. I think if I would've been helped a little I wouldn't be like this at all, if I had my mom I wouldn't have developed most of this things and I would've been taught to be more sentisitve, because that's the way she was. . . I've been told by people on reddit that I'm full of shit,been told by girls that I rap*d people, that I'm a piece of shit and I should turn myself in (I don't think i could deny that), even a guy told me that I'm making shit up to sound better, but I'm not, I don't think this was avoidable, I was fighting with mental disparity and r4pey shit since a kid and I think I didn't deserve to do so. I think I might have has narcissistic,schizophrenic disorders or sickness without knowing, and I think that my whole life lead me to this, I didn't knew really more than abuse when it came to my home or social life, i had told this to some people and they told me that my friends from college and the environment there was too creepy and they never saw shit like that. . . Concluding, I'm doing better, I puke everyday and cry everyday because I don't think my life has a meaning anymore, but deep down I know I can help my brother so he doesnt traumatized his kid or wife, I know I can help kids to know things better, and in this moment I think I should swallow my pride and realize an even more lonely life expects me. I think I should go out just to play ball, buy groceries, go to therapy and that's it. I want to quit my degree and study psychology or be a teacher, I think I had a lot of knowledge to teach people but I don't think i will be able to do so. I won't kill myself and that's a promise, I know this post sounds like a straight up suicide letter but I won't, my dad did too much for me to ending killing myself. I will go to therapy too and try to get solutions, but I think that a lonely life is what I deserve. I would love to have a gf, would love to feel love from a girl as I never felt besides my sister , I would love to show a girl that I will only do good things for her. But I think it's too late, I think it's too late for me to turn my life around and I should just move silently to help from the shadows. I would love to read your opinions but if not it's all good. . . I analize myself and think what in the world lead me to  act like that and I don't know honestly, I can't see myself sober doing that type of shit, and there's other times that I feel that I am sick and might  do that shit again.. For example when I got drunk some weeks ago I didn't give a shit anymore, I was alone testing myself if my thoughts changed,I thought behaving like that wasn't a big deal , and on the other side other times feel  like my life is over, thanks In advance for your help.. . I don't know how I got to be like this, I don't know how my values and principles  changed that much, most of the times I think, nah my life wasn't that tragic and when i tell my friends about my childhood experiences and their faces falls of because they get surprised and don't even understand things like this, I just wish I stopped going to this disturbed parties, I wish I had better friends, I wish I could've  opened with people when I was younger to gain experience in a sane way, I wish my life could've been a little better, I think I already failed as a man and as a son,brother or friend and it is true. I feel sick and I feel like I am that calm kid again  now but I guess is too late for me again. I guess I have to stop b1tch1ng and hold my things together, but my mood swings and it really goes low and up. I think I had gone thru all my shit nicely until I was 18.",suicide

"My face is keeps getting uglier and I can’t handle this anymoreI used to be pretty. It was all I had going for me and I’m not just saying that. I’m not smart, I have a debilitating mental illness and and have very low daily function, I’m quiet and I don’t have any hobbies, interests or talents. These past few years pretty much all I’ve been able to do is go in and out of the hospital. So people used to tell me I was pretty and beautiful and it would give me a little bit of a reason to live and it made me feel good about myself. Since March, I’ve developed Fordyce spots on my lips, my skin has started breaking out and worst of all I looked in my mirror one day and realized my chin had moved to the left and my face was no longer symmetrical. I’ve also started grinding my teeth so my face is always puffy and swollen and my jawline is much rounder now. I immediately got braces and was told it would fix the asymmetry but I’m hearing different things from different people and I’m starting to think I will look like this forever. I don’t care how shallow this sounds I will take all my pills and kill myself if my face gets any worse. I am trying so hard not to kill myself because my brother killed himself when I was 17 and now I’m my parents only child and I don’t want them to have 2 dead children.

"Thought I might as well try thisWell, I'm really not sure why I'm doing this, it's really just to pass the time until I'm able to fuckin leave my house to act upon it. I've completely run out of things to do, things to cope, things to convince me that there's a reason to continue on. Talked with the crisis hotline a few days ago, and I told myself ""if this doesn't work then I'm giving up"" and i would just decide to say goodbye to it all, end the already non-existant future that i won't ever have because I honestly fuck everything up and can't get my shit together. . I can't even say how many times I've spoken to a hotline before. Maybe over 40 within the past two months. I have absolutely nobody else to talk to other than these hotlines, all my friends are gone, they all left, i still have some fake ones that i haven't cut off yet and my parents won't believe me. The only thing keeping me going is this damned coronavirus keeping me from leaving my house to go jump off a big ass building that's literally about 30 minutes away from me.. . Every time I get ""help"" it's always temporary, a few hours later all that's going to happen is I'll be back at square one crying my emotional bag-ass in bed trying to figure out what the hell i'm still doing being alive. This is also one of the main reasons of why I'm basically going to give up, what's the fucking use if it's not going to last me 4 hours? What am I supposed to do, distract myself from the pain and thoughts for years and years until I pass from old age? Die from a car crash? Hell no! I've tried too many times to get help, and none of it worked.. . I'll text the fucking crisis hotline, and it's nice, sure, it's nice to talk to somebody, but fucking hell does it end up being the same thing over and over again. It'll be like 3 AM, and they'll just keep fuckin saying ""How about you text in tomorrow if you feel like this again?"" same thing for the suicide hotline, that happened to me too, ""call in when you're feeling like you're about to kill yourself"" which if that's how much they care about me, I might as well not. No, I won't be feeling any better tomorrow. Why the hell would I be texting in and getting dispatched 50 times beforehand? Fuck it, dude.. . &amp;#x200B;. . All I've gotten so far has been ""It'll get better, give it time."" Fuck giving it time! How much time, half of my life? No! I'm not doing that. It's already felt like forever! I don't think there's anybody at all that gives a shit about me anymore. Honestly, my parents, nope, my friends, they're all fuckin gone, they're all fake they don't even know I exist. What the hell do I have to do to convince myself ""I won't feel like this for a long long time."" Nothing! That's literally the absolute only only only thing that will convince me, and I know for a big ass fact that will never occur. I was even talking to this girl from my school about it, we were talking because she knew how I felt about it. I remember saying ""It's just going to go back to square one every few hours"" and then she all up just says ""Well, Ryan, you've just explained life."" Excuse me? You're telling me I have to endure this pain 50 times over a lifetime. What the fuck is the point of living dude? To be hurt? To sit here in complete agony waiting for a time where I will have the ability to run away from home. Then I'll be free of my house, the pain, especially my thoughts once I end it all, and I'll be happy as shit. Fuck.. . One of my literal only ways to cope: Stay up! Never ever sleep. If you don't sleep, your brain won't have enough time to think. And yeah, sure, it works. Not sleeping works wonders. But again, it's fucking temporary. Like absolutely everything in this damned world. Fuck me!. . I'm tired as hell, it's 2 AM here, and there's probably way more other points that I forgot to add on that I can't think about right now. I'll probably add on edits if I remember and if I feel like it, and if I'm physically able to.",suicide

"Involuntary hospitalization + mental health resources in universitiesA little bit of context: I am a 19 year old first year student at Stanford University. Stanford, and Palo Alto in general,  recently became hyper-sensitive about mental health and suicide because of the soaring suicide rates locally. . . So back in February, I was having a particularly low day. Unaware of the side effects of my meds(zoloft), I took 4 pills instead of 1 with hopes that my seratonin levels will boost immediately and I would feel better. The next day, I was not feeling well and on Monday I went to my school’s health center to get a check up. I told the people at psychological services about my overdose and I emphasized that it was not an attempt to harm myself. I told them about my suicide ideation and depression. Moments later, someone calls the campus police and I am involuntarily hospitalized for 72 hours under the 51/50 hold. . . In April, my depression has gotten worse, and I posted a suicide note on my social media. I was not planning to kill myself that day. I haven’t made specific plans. I just expressed that I don’t want to live anymore and that I’ll tell no one how and when I plan to die. The cops come in, check on me, and after realizing that I’m safe, they leave. My residential faculty, however, calls the cops again and I’m sent to the hospital involuntarily under 51/50. The psychiatrist at the hospital uplift the hold and let me go. . . I found a local therapist in Palo Alto. We have 4 initial intake sessions and I book appointments till June. I dropped 2 classes and decided to take intensive therapy for 6 hours a week in addition to medication. . . The school puts me on review for a forced leave of absence after the social media post incident. I write a written proposal on how I will prioritize my mental health and have 2 meetings with the associate dean of student affairs. He drops the review process after.. . I have a panic attack in the dining hall a week after. I feel dizzy, my eyesight is blurry, I can’t breathe properly, I’m trembling and crying. I’m scared. I feel like I am going to faint. I feel like I am going to die. My friend calls 911 and the ambulance came. I feel like I’m going to faint, so I lay my head on the wall. And I murmur that I need to die because it was so painful and scary. The campus police reports that I was banging my head on the wall and threatened others with suicide. I get on the 51/50 hold again and am sent to the hospital involuntarily. The psychiatrists there uplift the hold and let me go. . . The next day I go to my second session with my therapist. My mom freaked out by the school’s report of my panic attack yesterday and texted my therapist about it. My therapist considers firing me for threatening others with suicide. No matter how hard I try to persuade him that that was not the case, he doesn’t bend. He asks if I am suicidal. I tell him that I’ve been having suicidal thoughts, and while I do not plan on acting on them right now, I’m scared because my depression is pretty severe. I tell that I want treatment and help to get better. He asks me again if there is absolutely no chance that I will ever try hurting or killing myself. I say not right now, but I can’t guarantee that 100% it will never happen forever. He fires me and calls 911. I am handcuffed and sent to a psych ward again involuntarily. . . At the ward, a psychiatrist evaluates me and she told me that the university and my therapist was hypersensitive to a totally treatable condition. She concludes that there is no reason why I can’t return to campus and finish the quarter. She discharges me. . . I hear from the nurses at the ward that the school kicked me out of the dorm. I have a meeting with the associate dean. I explain to him that there was a miscommunication and I do not plan to harm myself and am willing to find a new therapist, receive treatment, take my meds, and finish the quarter. He tells me that I am disruptive to the Stanford campus community and can’t take care of myself. He puts me back on review for an involuntary leave of absence. I receive an email that I am not allowed to set foot on any dining or residence hall without a residence dean next to me. . . I have to defend myself in front of a panel of three judges in order to stay. My mom flies from Korea. She cries, and tells me to come home. . . With three weeks left in the quarter, I withdraw from my classes and come home. I had a research position for the summer on campus, but the school doesn’t allow me to stay. . . My summer plans are fucked, and I am emotionally destroyed. . . I’m scared of people. I feel like I’m exposing myself when i leave the house. I just am too scared of others and feel hyper-protective. My depression has reached its worse. . . . . Making students feel more integrated to the university community and building a solid system of humane and reasonable accommodation and support would really improve the  safety of Stanford students. Hopefully, that will even reduce the number of suicides on campus! Proactive measures are more important than reactive measures. . . I firmly believe and recognize the need for change to make the universities a more welcoming, safer place for ALL students regardless not just of gender, race, ethnicity, but also disability conditions.",suicide

"Some weird personal fever dream I had, that I attempted to turn into a short poem/story. (Warning some gore)*I might delete this at some point, I guess I’ll see how I feel. I have a bad habit sometimes of just deleting things that bother me in life.. . But anyways, here it is: . . . At one time, there were two families with drastically different ideas of perfection and what to make of their homes that lived across from one another. The one family was mine, and I had a revelation that the other would eventually have enough of our differences and challenge my sense of normality. But I brushed this dream off, and still headed over to the house to see my friend. When I arrived, my friend and I just spent time looking out their window, people watching, as we usually did, but they said something strange to me, that made me feel uncomfortable...”Do you think that different preferences are a disease of the mind?” They sounded sincere, and the peculiarity of it deeply troubled me. “What?” I stumbled. They showed me how our house, had two different vases next to one another, each holding different but beautiful flowers. They then spun me vigorously around to an identical table they had in their house, but on top of this table was a vase that was split into two, crumbling pieces that just sat there heavily enshrined in puddles of some adhesive. A shriveled plant was left to welt on the table, and the soil lay sprawled out around it. The water was long evaporated. I felt frozen, and then when I thought things couldn’t get any worse, I turned around and saw a copy of me being held in the air. Tears streaming down their cheeks. But they didn’t make a sound. My friend and some other new person where each grabbing a side of my copy. Without being able to move or speak, I just stood there in horror, and relief, and watched as they were about to tear them in two. I watched frozen in place, as they tore them completely in two. Their insides fell into a bloody heap on the pristine floor, staining it and my innocence. Until eventually, everything turned pitch black.. . I later woke up with blurry vision in the ER. Apparently the authorities wanted to see me cause I had some traces of foreign blood on my hands. They then escorted me to where my supposed “friend’s” house had been, but all that lay their now was a valley of ashes that seemed to stretch for miles across their property. I couldn’t feel or remember anything, and they suspected my brain had underwent some kind of trauma. They took me to some local facility to stay in, and I was being watched almost all the time with other kids my age. . . One day, the authorities came into see me again, and asked me if I knew what happened to my parents. I shook my head no. My mind which had once been a steel trap, was now a blank slate. No more blades to cut away at the underbrush that grew as it pleased in my mind. I was forced to deal with my reality head on. I decided I couldn’t stay where I was anymore. I had to leave.. . I escaped late in the evening, while the other residents were asleep. One had reminded me of someone, but I couldn’t place my finger on who. Their voice was so delicate yet strong, and they didn’t look well, but somehow they still wanted to persist with life. They amazed me, but I suspect I’ll never know them. . . I went to where my house had supposedly been. That was one thing I was good at remembering. Numbers and codes. I entered the house and felt...nothing. Eh, it’s not like I expected to or anything, just maybe hoped to. I looked around the dark and cold house. I guess I was looking for evidence of what happened to my supposed parents, or things I used to feel a connection to? Since they never told me anything, they just...questioned me intensely. So I poked around, and suddenly came across a cracked door, that had a light on. I hesitated, but then decided to open it. I mean what was I going to do, not open it? So I went downstairs, and discovered a huge cement wall that had the phrases “You’re faking everything” and “Everything you love isn’t even real” slathered in blood. I lost the ability to feel, like, everything, so I just starred and didn’t really know what to do next. Until, out of the corner of my eye. I spotted...them. It was my old “friend.” They walked out into the light, and said to me, “I bet you don’t remember what happened here, do you?” “No” I nonchalantly said. “Well,”. they continued, “let’s just say I had fun using your hand with teaching your parents a thing or two about some proper symmetry.” “I taught who what?” I stumbled. “Oh!” They laughed a sound that stung some part of me. “That little procedure worked better than I intended!” I felt really tired all of a sudden and out of nowhere collapsed. I started breathing pretty fast, and then really slow, exasperated breaths. “You poor thing, don’t you see, your mine now, and I’m all you have left.” I couldn’t say anything, I felt like I was slowly rotting. Well, to be honest I felt like I had been rotting for awhile, but now it was real. This was my home now, but it was a living nightmare. A world I lived in where my fear and the unpleasantness of it all was real. My “friend” noticed my suffering. They had always been in tune with it somehow. They pulled out a knife and medication, all the while assuring me they were only there to make sure I would feel as little pain as possible. Telling me that I earned it just this one time. But just then, before they could finally end this hell. I felt someone else grab me. It was my copy. They...were alive...and so was I. They held me for a moment. They weren’t crying, just profusely apologizing. I didn’t understand what it was about. Until they finally threw up due to the exhaustion and pain, but stomach acid didn’t come up as expected. Rather, a stream of memories and a mix between triggering and personal objects poured out of their gapping mouth. My eyes became clear, and everything was restored...except for everything that wasn’t. As my copy hugged me and told me we were now finally safe and sound, they choose to go down the path of forgetting the horrors they and my “friend” trapped me in days before.. . I finally realized how little I meant to me.",suicide

I am someone who tends to share my thoughts on things. this text was also written in the 50s, so I disagree with many things (for example, people have a medicine cabinet full of things that they don't know what they do, but they hang on to it just in case. my family does not keep medicine that we don't know the purpose of.) all in all, it made me feel like an idiot for not recognizing that. and part of the reason I felt like an idiot was because I shared my thoughts about all the things we read. if I hadn't shared my thoughts, I would not have felt like an idiot.

"How to not be brokenI really need help. I feel like I'm too broken to be fixed and if I can't get better, I shouldn't be here.. . Second semester of my freshman year, I was sexually assaulted. First semester, I got into an abusive ""relationship"" that continued through the assault with a different person. Since then, I haven't been able to function in school. Or only a little bit. I used to be good at school, as long as it didn't involve writing. I also have ADHD, but I don't know if that's why I struggle with writing. I failed a class that semester and did worse in all my other classes. Then I failed an online course over the summer. Then I did very badly in a semester of classes at a local college during a forced stay at home. Then I took a semester off. I worked hard to get my scholarships back (ultimately failing to follow through on an important final step for one of them.) I couldn't afford to go to a different school because I'm not a freshman. I depend on an almost full scholarship to attend school at all. I auditioned for a different department and got in, but not for the concentration I'm interested in. When I got back to school, my mother read my journal in which I detailed explicitly my assault. She doesn't understand or regret what she did to this day, although our relationship somewhat recovered. I was already insecure about not getting into the concentration I wanted, but then I was surrounded by crazy talented people who did get in and it hit hard. I wanted to ultimately study acting, but I wasn't sure I could be good enough. So I proceeded to barely make it to my classes for a semester, take two Is and a W and a very generous B. I was also scared of my roommate.. The next semester I withdrew entirely. During a week that seemed vital, I felt like I had made my partner feel unsafe and panicked and tried to kill myself.

I'd like to lie in bed for my entire life and forget about the world.. . Worst of all is that I have no sex drive. I'm not even attracted to people anymore. I'd rather stare at the ground or at my phone than someone of the opposite sex. I told my closest friend this and she thinks I might be asexual. I don't know, I'm just so hollow.",suicide
Hi Everyone I am trying to make a form to workout what colour is associated with different emotions. if you could take a moment to fill the form out it would be super helpful. Ok.

"Don't know if I want to die or just not remember.So I'm older than 25 and younger than 35. Ever since I was in my early teens I have wanted to not exist anymore. Tried to kill myself 3 times over the years. It has gotten worse though. A couple years back someone I was engaged to slept with pretty much every friend I had (we had been together for many years and nothing like that had happened before) over a short period of time. There's more and much worse to it if you could even believe it's possible but I will leave it at that. Like I said it's been a few years since that happened and it destroyed me so much that I haven't been able to make a friend or have any kind of relationship, sexual or otherwise since. The darkness is just overwhelming at this point and I don't even know how to feel feelings. I think the only reason the first three times failed is because I'm actually terrified of how I will be portrayed when I die and the fact that I can't answer the question of what happens when I do. So here I sit next to a lead pipe wanting to bash my head in hard enough that I don't remember anything about my life but not hard enough to die because I am lost. I've tried everything. Meds. Therapy. It doesn't seem to help. I don't even believe in god and I feel like he's out to get me. I don't even know what to do. I just don't want to know anything that's happened in my life. Captcha wants to know if I'm human. Good question.",suicide
"I hate everyone and this world in generalEveryone I know and have trusted has let me down in some way. This world isn't worth it and everyone who says that is a liar. This world is just a giant piece of shit. I don't hate myself or anything, I know I'm a good person and I tried my best. What I hate is everyone else. Even if I get good things in life it won't make me happy. The thought of living to even 50 years in a world like this is incomprehensible to me. Every time I try to do the right thing the liars, morally bakrupt people try to turn in around and I get in even more trouble. Every time I tried to turn my garbage life around I get dragged right back down. If I could order a hitman to kill me I would do it. No one needs to reply to this and in fact I'm not expecting anyone to. It would be typical for me and for my life.",suicide

"Offing yourself isn't that easyPlanning to off yourself is annoyingly intricate. You have to figure out where and how and when. Where can you go that no one you care about will find you, but someone else will. How are you going to do it? You've Google searched ""Least painful ways"" but where will you get the supplies and how will you keep anyone from finding out? . . The most complicated piece to me is when. Should you do it before or after your family vacation? You wouldn't want to ruin it for everyone, but it seems phony to go along. Do you have enough money saved up so your husband can still pay the rent for a while? You did just sign a new lease last month. Do you have time to touch base with the people you'll miss the most and let them know how special and important they are to you. . . Should you write a note? If it doesn't work are you prepared to live on under worried, watchful eyes and heavy prescription that makes you feel even emptier than you already are? . . You don't know how people can just pick a day and step off the side of a bridge.. . You keep telling yourself, ""Next week is the week. No more procrastinating. It's not rocket science."" . . In the end you'll probably just postpone it a little longer. Not because you're afraid to do it, you're not. You're just to afraid to leave any burden on all the hearts left behind. . ",suicide
"I feel stupid because a heartbreak started thisThroughout my life, I was never really happy, just okay and fine with that, occasionally suicidal at hard times but never serious about it. Until June last year when I found him. I experienced the highest of highs with him.. . In February I was dumped by the only person I've ever truly loved, more than anything. I spiralled downwards from there, being severely suicidal at the start of lockdown, but kind of eventually started to feel better and a bit hopeful.. . In June we reconciled, and I was so happy again. But at the start of July, he dumped me again, this time for good, and cut me out of his life entirely. . . I decided to try the single life and see if that could be good for me, but I discovered some awful things on a sub for single men, and I started getting resentful towards men. I joined a dating site especially to break down egotistical guys through rejecting them. . . I saw more and more awful things in people, in the world, in life, as I did all of this. I began to hate more than just men, I began to hate the world and being in it. It's a terrible and dark place to be in. But through this, I had 4 internet friends (real life friends all abandoned me when I started getting depressed) that I thought I could count on, 2 of them guys. . . In the last week, I lost both of those guy friends, one because he wanted to focus on himself, and the other because he doesn't like who I've become. And this really hit me hard, I have 2 friends left. And I feel like just isolating myself from everyone because they're all going to abandon me in the same way.. . Added to that, I'm losing my childhood home this week, the place I grew up in an found comfort in, and it just hurts so much. I don't want to leave, but I have to.. . I've sort of become a bit of a drug addict as I now tend to use prescription medications to numb out the pain I feel, and that's the only time I feel relatively normal, but I know I'm doing long term damage to my body. And the one thing I never thought I'd be is a drug addict, yet here I am, a drug addict.. . My career dream is also impossible to reach because of not having money to and because of my deteriorating health. I experienced fluoroquinolone toxicity which caused heart problems that could make me fail a medical. And if I don't get this career path, I don't have a passion for anything else and I feel so purposeless. . . Starting on September 23, is every romantic anniversary with my ex. And it already hurts so much to go through friendship anniversaries, so I know these are going to be worse. He was my hope and my happiness, I loved him with all of my heart, now I have to go through these dates alone, missing him and the times we had together last year, wondering what could've been if he stayed. And so many songs remind me of specific memories of him, that it's difficult to escape, and I love music.. . A lot of the time I wish I'd never met him. I wouldn't have known the happiness that I felt with him, and I wouldn't know the horrible things I've seen as a result of losing him.. . I've been in therapy since March and it's made absolutely no difference to my state of mind at all, I'm still actually deteriorating. So that's a lost cause for me.. . A lot of other bad things and losses happened to me this year, but at this time they're minor ones compared to what I've mentioned here.. . I feel so afraid, alone, in pain, and like everything I dare to care about abandons me.. . I don't see a future for myself in the world that I've seen and experienced. It's awful and I've been so disillusioned. I have no hope left. I wish I still had that innocence that I did during my school years, but it's all gone and I've experienced adult life, it's horrible.. . I planned my suicide for my last night in my childhood home, this weekend. I'll ask to stay here alone for just one more night, overdose on a combo of benzos and opiates and sit in the bath, hopefully passing out and drowning, but maybe also dying of respiratory depression. I want to die in the place I grew up. End it all where it started.. . I don't really want to be convinced out of it by saying that people care, random people on the internet don't know me and won't feel the loss. I have 2 internet friends left who'll probably leave anyway, so they won't feel it either. I think only my family would feel it, but they'd survive because we aren't that close anyway. . . I just wanted to put this on here, get my feelings out somehow, somewhere that people can see it but not overreact, where they'd understand where I'm coming from.",suicide
"I actually wanna commit die So I'm like 15 years old and have an Asian family and yes this is where this shit sucks.. Its more like being born anywhere where I live sucks, I'm forced to study and there is no other career option rather than being an engineer or a doctor.. What makes it worse is I have a mega nerd TWIN SISTER who keeps studying like 24/7, this shit makes my parents expect me to be also studying like  25 hours a day.. .

And tbh watching subreddits like r/mademesmile and other wholesome subreddits make me feel even worse as to seeing how strangers help each other and here my family pressurizes me to study take up a career and gaming is a crime.. . I basically have a true redditor live but make it even worse. . btw I meant no hate towards my family rather I'm super pissed, I didn't explain like everything so it must be super unclear what I'm actually trying to say..

"After almost a year of no longer cutting myself. Im in a worse spot than ever.All throughout high school cutting myself seemed like the best vice, I wasn't hurting anyone else so I didn't feel guilty. After three years of cutting one of my best friends found out and put it too a stop(she's the best). A few weeks later I met and eventually asked out my amazing gf, I had never been in love like that before, no one had ever made me care so much. So when she told me she had to move, I was crushed. To make a long story short she became incredible distant to the point where she would text people I was around(knowing we were together) and not answer me. We had been the best couple so I tried to make it work. She told me she would come to visit, but she never did, and when I asked when I could come down, she told me it would be too expensive. So I stopped kidding myself and broke up with her. A month later and she is still leading me on, telling me I'm the friend she wants to date and occasionally joking that its my fault because I made the move to end it. I still love her and she's an amazing person, but I feel fucking worthless. I've tried so hard to be a good person, and every fucking day it gets a little harder to get out of bed, I'm not even sad anymore and I've dealt with depression for a long time. But it feels like I'm living through life with fake smiles and hollow laughs, I've only been happy once, but looking back on it,even it was a lie. Cutting doesn't seem like it's enough anymore.

"theres no spiders thread for me.in a story, a man condemnd to hell almost escapes from a spider thread gifted to him by the only good deed he has done in his life. im not as fortunate, i may be a despicable monster by my standards but i havent wronged anyone. just lead a pathetic life. makes me sad seeing people who've been in similar circumstances in anime, but they always have a happy ending. either its a blessing bestowed on them, or just a person actually helping and comforting them in real life. id add online help except people online dont really care about people they will never meet. they dont go out of their way aside a couple messages and sooner rather then later give up. im the only one trying to make myself happy while the world gives up on me and then crushes me beneath its heel in all its cruelty. i just want a break or two. a job, a life, a chance to get by. not constant misery with a bleak road to my grave. hell, even if i had choices in life and all of them led directly to my grave id be a bit happier because then im actually influencing my life with my choices rather then being stuck on a rail. but its just a path of thorns that has me hating myself and questioning if im really a good person or not. am i good when i help a old woman grab something from a high shelf at the store? or is that just being in the mood to help people? at what point do my actions redeem the kind of person i am? i dont mean to be sadistic and cruel with my thoughts, its just how i am. i cant change myself anymore then i already have and even then, i regret the pieces of me i left behind with my childhood. im always sacrificing something to be happy, or for a little bit of joy. but when does that end? it doesnt even balance out with as much as i sacrifice, not that i have much to give anyways. im worthless after all, hardly suitable for anything other then slavery but at that point i would be just torturing myself more of course. itd be nice to not worry about not having food or shelter though, as long as they didnt decide to kill me off. shouldnt be trying to find the pros in that stuff though.... mabey im complaining for nothing? mabey my life is easy and im ungrateful? have i really suffered or am i just whiny?  others have had harder lives then me..... i could be more poor, i could be more stupid, i could have physical disabilities, i could be starving, i could be enslaved, i could be abused more. i dont think i could hate myself more though, im the person i hate most in the world. think im stupid? well tough shit because i think im retarded! think im mean? well i think im a monster in sheeps skin! or fur? which was the saying? think im ugly? well i think im hideous! after all, you only see what i show..... im nothing without my mask. i pretend to be this nice guy who is amazing at everything because i know im the exact oopposite. every good trait about me are just left overs of who i used to be. but getting broken down in life leaves you with very little of your former self and i have only myself to blame for not holding myself together and staying out of those situations better. i say my life is terrible, but im the one who caused it to be like this. i could blame the kids who mocked me, the parents who neglected me, the friends who betrayed me, but i could also just as easily say that i could of just been a person who isnt mock-worthy, presevered myself and led a life that wouldnt let my parents neglect me, and not put so much faith in friends or avoided them in the first place. im tired, tired of being hated, alone, and given up on. nothing makes you feel more worthless then glaring eyes at the back of your head, laying in a dark room alone on a holiday, and then countless times of seeking help only to find people telling you its youre fault which i already knew or that they just stop responding and give up. not that there was help to begin with though i guess. no talking will solve my life problems, they are just facts of life. a rock is still just a rock in the end of the day. also, all this shit sounds melodramatic edgy garbage. but its how i talk about my self in a negative light. i get poetic in a vomit inducing way.",suicide

It's odd I was in a hospital for months hearing excuses from Doctors who didn't operate on my spine because they were to afraid of being sued and then said they could not give me medicine for pain because new regulations say only cancer patients get opioid pain medicine, but someone like me with a broken back and impacted spinal cord should suffer for their money and vanity. Long story short after 6 months of suffering the one family member who cares anything about me rushed me to another state were they immediately drugged me and operated on me to fix my spinal cord but because the doctors from my state kept me so long and without treatment i lost one of my legs and part of another one along with a fragile spine now that is barely held together. So now I'm trapped, I cant sit very long, I can't walk really, I cant work so I lay down in pain from my nerve endings still burning and watch this disgusting world. I once had a nice career a house money and love. Now i live on $829 a month from the government and all that goes to medicine, insurance, and my only possession, my car. . .

"Grasping at straws to go this farIm sorry for this. I don't like publicly breaking down but I don't know what else to do. I'm clinically depressed and I'm driving myself mad with thoughts of suicide and constant memories thimgs I've done wrong. I feel I may end my life if I can't convince myself to change.. . Some background I guess. I'm in my early twenties (angst red flags firing already? Afraid not), I was diagnosed with clinical depression over a year ago by 2 GPs (I wanted a second opinion). I, like everyone else, experienced changes in emotion throughout my life but this was the longest prolonged drop in mood which has continued to today. Sometimes I feel I've come out of it. I've lasted five days at my best at one point. Now it's at its worst so far.. . I've tried a number of medications, no good, and I've lost faith in the validity of most antidepressants.. I've tried therapy, I could see the little nuances ticking in their heads. I was never seen as a person, Just a (boring and complicated) puzzle to be solved. While I don't judge them for it, therapy wouldn't work for me. . Ive tried confiding in family, I could see the hurt in their eyes as I described how I felt and I just can't take that anymore either. Now I cry wolf at being cured when I see them. They may suspect but they'll never be sure.. I've lost all my friends. This happened slowly and to some level on purpose. I could no longer connect with acquaintances, every conversation felt like I was mentally bashing my head against a wall. It was an unnatural, uncontrollable cognitive dissonance that spread like a tumour until even the people closest to me felt like distant dreams accross hallucinated worlds. . I became so desperate I called a suicide hotline. I tried to describe how I felt and they kept repeating rubbish like ""it's good that you've reached out to us today"". When we reached the 30 minute mark and she couldn't understand how I felt she hung up on me. I told her early on I was suicidal that night and a suicide hotline refused to help me. (you may call bullshit, and that's fine, I don't care. I have nothing to gain by lying to you now).. . My state of mind doesn't feel normal, nor is it consistent. Like a rat in a maze i often feel I've found out how to escape only to find a dead end. I've had enough. For all intents and purposes I don't think I'm a bad guy, just an average joe who has done some stupid things before. But even so I can't stop believing I truly deserve this, to be in a constant state of mental pain that no other human can see and thus cannot understand, until one day I finally give up and just end it all. I want out, I want out of this constant fog, the 16 hours of sleep followed by random bouts of insomnia, the inability to hold a conversation, the poor work ethic, the selfishness. I just want to be fucking normal just like every other god damn mother fucker I see arround me. . . R/suicideWatch. I imagine many of you have experienced this before, it's a classic case of clinical depression. I don't want fucking by-the-book-waste-of-time answers. ""oh your family will miss you"" ""it will pass in time"" ""I'm here for you"" ""have you tried (suchandsuch drug and/or therapy)"" ""it's good you've reached out"" fuck you kinds of people. I also don't give a shit about the guidelines here. If you are a real fucking human being, with some real sence and want to offer some advice please please do. You won't get any reward other than maybe self satisfaction, stroke your ego a bit, tell your friends how you 'saved someone', get an upvote, I don't care. I'm a dick, and a loser and a fucking human being grasping at straws who just wants someone real to help me.",suicide

"I know what I want in life but everyone is shitting on me.So a few years ago I got into producing and recording music. I was stuck in a college degree I have learned to hate (not in US, so I didn´t have to take on huge amounts of debt) so I decided to drop out, eventhough the likelihood of having a six-figure income in the future would have been pretty much 100&amp;#37; if I continued.. . Since then I have been doing pretty much nothing but producing, recording and engineering music. But everyone that knows about this says I should ""be realistic"" about what I want and get into a different field. I have gotten so obsessed with music that I spent around 12-16 hours, 7 days a week getting better and building a catalog. Reality is though, that nobody really gives a shit. I only know a hand full of people that really listened to my music and they figured that I am not the average joe getting into this, because they know how long I have been doing this and seen the extremely fast pace that I am progressing at. In fact the first song I have ever written and played for a few friends (not telling them at first that it was my own) the reaction was: ""OMG you wrote that song?! You have to become a pro musician!""  (after telling them the that I actually wrote it). . . That´s how I figured out that I have a talent for songwriting.. . My biggest problem right now is my parents trying to force me into some field I really dont give a damn about. I told them that in a few years  I will commit suicide if I am not able to establish myself as a full time recording artist / producer. The more I think about it, the more I actually consider following through, if I don´t make the cut. . . What really fuels all of these thoughts is the nihilistic perspective that I developed. I really believe this might be the one and only opportunity to do what you want. Who knows what will happen after death? My parents say that I am selfish for thinking about suicide and I told them that I never asked to be born and automatically sign a contract to serve everyone else\`s selfish desires. I also know that I don´t want any kids, so that they don´t have to go through the whole process. The only circumstance that I would ever consider becoming a parent would be if I actually achieved my dream. So I don´t have to get at them with that ""oh, sorry nobody told you that you are basically screwed when you are born, you don´t really have that many choices in life, and only a few lucky people get to live their dreams! So (wo-)man up! Just climb the corporate ladder!"". . I don´t believe in that mentality. Unless you are physically not viable for your dream (e.g. being a model or an NBA player). I really do believe in ""the harder you work, the luckier you get"".. . I have visited a psychiatrist and the only thing that I got was a prescription for Zoloft (which I learned has nasty side effects). Basically they are telling me: ""Well do whatever you want, just take these pills, so that you can accept ""the reality"" you were born in, eventhough you know that you hate it and are just numbing yourself with these pills"". . I have not taken a single pill and most likely won´t ever do it.  . . . TLDR;  . Dropped out of college (no debt) and found out what I really want to do in life.  . Already putting in ridiculous work hours into my passion.. . Family and friends are suggesting to go into a different direction because ""be realistic"".  . I set a suicide date in the future, if dreams don´t work out.  . Got a prescription for Zoloft, to basically numb my true self, because ""be realistic"".  . ",suicide

"and so it goesI'm stuck here in this meat in an utterly meaningless existence with nothing to look forward to. Sleeping doesn't help because all I have is hideous nightmares, getting fucked up helps mildly for a few hours(but then I have to face the consequences of the stupid things I've said and done so it's not really worth it). I've lost the ability to make friends because the only thing I can talk or think about is how much I hate being alive.

"I struggled with suicide after my best friend died, I know it is mostly focused on becoming sober but I also know there may be someone here who might not feel so alone after reading my story. There is always hope, just remember that when al feels lost.Today will mark 1 year and 6 months I haven’t had a drop of alcohol in me. . . I want to tell you all my story as it may help some in need and reassurance that you can get better.. . Be the change you wish to see.. . My sobriety has come bu my choice to change, to never be under the influence of that devil again, ever.. . No one told me I had to, I did this for myself.. . In January of 2016 I quit smoking weed and May of that year I graduated from Avtec, I was building a cabin that fall with my then wife and we were on our way to a happy life. . . That fall Steven has helped me build it and we were putting in a foundation for his cabin behind mine on my parents property, we were doing it! We were building our homes.. . Around the end of November my mother went to Idaho because my grandfather was loosing his battle with cancer, she told me one night on the phone I should fly down and see him as it may be the last time I get to.. . I went to the store the night before my flight and as I was leaving I saw Steven, I told him I would be back in a week and that my grandpa wasn’t doing so well, I gave my best friend a hug and told him I loved him.. . On the day I flew home from down south I got a call that changed my life. I had landed in anchorage and when I turned on my phone I had several missed called and two voicemails, one from dad and one from Ashley, I had a text from her that said call me. . . When she answered she was shook, something wasn’t right. She told me Steven had been hit and killed on the highway and was dead.. . This is what pain feels like, this is what hell is. I didn’t even winch and tears flooded my face, the guy sitting next to me asked what was wrong and I just said ever so calmly “my best friend just died.”. . I sat there at the airport waiting to go to Kenai shocked and fucked up. It hadn’t hit me hard yet, about half way home in the sky I turned to a baby. I’ve never cried that hard ever, I shook, i trembled and was a mess.. . My two good friends John and Jess were waiting for me at the airport along with Ashley, I saw John and fell into his chest sobbing in disbelief, this can’t be happening.. . The ride to my parents house I screamed and kicked and was mad and sad all in the same emotion. . . Words will not be able to describe how I felt.. . I went home that night and had a drink, I drank enough to go to sleep. When I woke up the next day I was screaming and crying. This went on for the next few weeks.. . Brad moved back from Utah that month of December, I think he came back cuz he knew I needed him more than ever. I don’t know why he came back but I was so grateful to have him.. . I had spiraled Into a bad way I was 330 pounds, my side hurt every morning and I was drinking a bottle to two bottle of liquor a night, I couldn’t even tell you the amount of beer I would drink either. I was an over weight asshole, a complete monster who didn’t give a fuck. I was hiding a habit I had from my loved ones and even my closest of friends and people who cared about me didn’t know how bad it was, I was throwing up blood and if I didn’t have a drink in the morning I shook. . . July of 2017 my grandpa passed away, guess what I did. Drink.. . A year and a few weeks after my brother and best friend was killed and several months after grandpa died I tried chewing on a barrel, it was a rough week of extreme suicidal thoughts and self harm, I wanted to be dead. I was a fingers flinch away from seeing Steven.. . And I hated life and hated what I had become.. . I called my grandmother in tears one night after loading a .45, i stammered out a cry for help. She called my mother and soon my mom came over to see me. . . At that point we decided it was time to go to treatment, as much as I did not want to do it I went, I was on Xanax and smoking more weed than anyone should. I was fucked up in and out. That’s when I stoped drinking.. .  I went to a suicide treatment center in Anchorage Alaska, when I returned home 10 days later I stayed with a very good friend and brad and he let us live at his house while I pulled myself together. My wife at the time had started to distant herself from the  situation, rightfully so. I was mean when I drank and though I never was physical, emotional abuse hurts just as much of not more. I will be the first to admit it and say I was wrong, so extremely wrong. It sickens me to think I was once that animal and that version of Lane should have had his ass kicked many times over. . . During the month of January 2018 I smoked weed and took Xanax till I found a rehab that would take me in. Here I come Arizona, I asked my good friend Wesley to fly with me to Arizona, I didn’t trust myself to go alone.. . On the last flight to Nevada from Seattle someone had stole my bottle of Xanax from my backpack, I freaked out.. but being the party animal I had become I always kept pills in my wallet, I had 5 10 milligram bars left so I went to the bar, ordered a beer and a double shot popped the pills and drank the last sip of alcohol I’ve had in a year and a half. Got on the plane and went to sleep.. . When I had woke up in Las Vegas we went to the grey hound station to get on a bus to go to Arizona, Inwas still buzzing hard off that pill and booze concoction, feeling amazing I walked out onto the street to smoke a cigarette and a huge black guy walked up and asked if I wanted to party as he pulled out what looked like an 8 ball of cocaine. I was thrilled, everything in me wanted to go with him, but as I was about to make a bad decision Wesley called me over as our bus was getting ready to leave.. . That devil guy works in mysterious ways too my friends.. . I got on the bus and we went to rehab, 8 hours later we are in Mesa Arizona, I gave Wesley a hug and told him I loved him and thank you as I entered rehab on February 12 2018, my sober date, this is where I would spend the next two months learning how to live a life without drugs or alcohol.. . My ex wife had stopped all communication at this time and it was driving me crazy, I hadn’t understood how much of an asshole I was and thought she would be happy I was getting better. Every call I made to her I said I was sorry in voicemails, never a response.. . After those two months my emotion state of mind was collapsing as I had not heard from her at all, confused and conflicted with myself I decided it was time to go home. I had missed Valentine’s Day, our wedding anniversary and her birthday, I felt very bad about it but I had to fix myself.. . I returned home, when I did my family didn’t know what to expect or think. I didn’t either.. . She had been posting photos of her with another guy on social media and she looked very happy. I kinda knew this was going to happen about half way through rehab. . . The second day home I arrived at my ex’s cabin and asked what was going on, she had moved on. She claimed to have wrote me a letter on our anniversary stating it was over, I never received this letter.. . I decided my sobriety was the most important thing and that I wanted to make it to a year and focus only on that, that is what I did.. . When the plane is getting ready to crash they say to make sure you put on the oxygen mask first before you help anyone else, so I pulled my mask on.. . I thought I should go to bethel with brad, that’s where we worked all summer and we had a blast, I was smoking weed and enjoying my life without booze.. . We made it all summer in the bush and decided to live to Colorado where I got a job making pizzas at a local ma and pa pizza shop, the owners and co workers treated me like family and supported me being sober. When I reached my one year mark on February I had a problem.. . What now?. . Back to bethel, that’s where I was all summer, working and enjoying another Alaskan summer.. . A little over a month ago my scoutmaster and mentor Doc had several emergency surgeries and we nearly lost him. So I did what I do when emotional pain comes around, I got stoned.. . When I was smoking with a friend I began a coughing fit and took myself to the bathroom, this is where I hacked up a huge black/greyish lung luggy that had a large amount of blood in it.. . I remember back to throwing up blood from drinking so much because I missed my friend that was killed, I was doing the same thing I had done with alcohol. That was the last night I smoked weed. I’ve been clean of marijuana for over a month now and am onto new brighter things.. . Now I get to help my scoutmaster get back to health and I couldn’t be more happy and proud of myself, because I wouldn’t have been asked to do this if I was still constant fucked up.. . I wanted to share this with anyone who might need to hear it, I don’t share this to gloat or to tell a horror story for attention, this is for me so I can remember how real it was, how bad things can get. Addiction is a hell of a ride, it will take all your dignity, it’ll strip you of your family and it WILL KILL YOU! . . I was lucky enough to pull my head outta my ass and realize there is more to this life that getting fucked up daily.. .

"Feeling conflicted, tired of livingThought this month was going to be better, but here I am on a familiar path towards dissociating and not giving a shit about anything anymore. There is a fraction of me that still cares about my life, but what’s the point when I plan on ending it? I tried to be productive this evening to distract myself but it’s now three in the morning and I’ve accomplished nothing. Nothing except pace around my room fixated on the idea of killing myself. I’ve been suicidal on-and-off since I was 14 years old, but always had a few reasons not to follow through. Things change, though. I have nothing to look forward to or use as motivation. My self esteem is non existent, and my anxiety and anger issues have worsened. My parents have left me spending every day being jumpy and on edge. My graduation is on the 28th, but that just equates to a few more weeks until my friends won’t have to deal with me anymore. I feel absolutely worthless and like a complete fool for keeping myself alive just to keep falling down the same hole again and again. ",suicide

"my gf is highly suicidalhi everyone,. . i was looking for some advice regarding helping my gf with her depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. she's had all of these for a while (3+ years) and has attempted suicide 3 times. we got into a small argument and i'm in a rut right now—she believes that she will not get better and is not willing to get better. it scares me a lot because she told me earlier this week she was willing to try for me but because of our argument she feels like i'm not always going to be there for her. i'm really scared that if we were to break up that she would be gone very soon after. i know being with her is an incentive not to commit suicide and i fully believe that she will get better if we continue to be together. however during depressive episodes and arguments she voids out that i exist or that i'm a support system and i was looking for advice on that.. . i know that i can only do so much and that there's no cure. but i wanna know how i can help when we get into arguments and she feels like i can't be there. she currently has no outside motivation aside from me (she dislikes all her family and her friends are not a priority). . . as a final point, i'm scared of the idea breaking up because i know the inevitable consequence and the guilt i'd feel. she has admitted already that if i'm not there, then she has no reason to keep going. . any advice is appreciated. she's the person i love and care for the most and the increasing frequency of suicidal thoughts/tendency to act on those thoughts is alarming to me",suicide

"It’s honestly really hard to find a girlfriend or a boyfriend that actually cares about you. A part of it, or at least a I believe is the fact that I go heads over toes on Elder Scrolls and Fallout Lore. The lores interesting to me, but no one really shares that interest. You might be thinking that I’m narrowing down my expectations a little too much. And that’s a great point. I do like playing guitar, writing and researching history. Again, a pretty rare commodity to come across. Do they have to like the same things as me? No, absolutely not. My point is that it’s hard finding someone that likes these among other things.. . The problem is that I don’t really see anyone truly caring for me. A relationship goes both ways, and yet there are people out there around my age who are just concerned about being clingy and having sex, the list goes on and on. . . When it comes to a partner, I want to be with someone who I enjoy spending time with. A friend, in a sort of way. A person that I care for and in turn, cares about me.

I'm absolutely fucking miserable and I know that I have the ability to change, but that isn't the empowering statement it should be - it's an acknowledgement that I need to be stronger, but I can't convince myself to do anything.

"Okay I think I'm going to kill myself because I feel like I was born on the wrong planet.I was just thinking, I really don't think I should be here. Even if I wasn't _literally_ born on the wrong planet, people don't like people like me. I'm sort of just set up to fail, I can't function in a world like this, and why should I deal with that? Why should I be forced to feel unhappy just because I got unlucky? Is life so unfair that even when you find a solution you're not allowed to use it because everyone else says ""No""?

Imagine living your whole life feeling like you shouldn't be here, and every time you try to go where you feel better you're shamed or punished for it.. . The only reason why I'd ever consider not killing myself is because I won't get to be in my world anymore. I'll be dead. But I don't care if that means I get to leave this awful one. I don't care if it means that nobody will criticize me for just being me, or telling me somethings wrong with me, that I'm broken, without ever even listening to me. Nobody hears me. When I'm dead I won't be happy, but I won't be sad either. I'm perfectly okay with just being and feeling nothing. I truly cannot think of a reason to not kill myself.. . .

"Well this sucks...Posting using my real account because... meh :(. . This is going to seem to be a bit discombobulated because I'm in a really bad place in my head at the moment, so apologies for that. I'm not acutely suicidal at present, but it's on a knife edge. . . FYI, I suffer from depression (medicated with 40mg of Citalopram) and borderline personality disorder (did two years of DBT and waiting for my psychiatrist to prescribe me topiramate). . . In short, my life has been one fuck up after another. My mother used to beat the shit out of me when I was a child and I was mercilessly bullied at school (for instance, when I was 16 I had a knife held to my throat in class and the teacher did absolutely nothing). I was - I guess the term is gifted - academically, but very lazy. I coasted through primary and secondary school (I'm English) though I managed to get provisionally accepted to a number of very prestigious universities. Naturally I fucked up my A-Level exams because I spent my time drinking and getting coked out of my head instead of studying so I ended up in some backwater hellhole. I also developed Tourettes Syndrome (motor and simple vocal tics), which was rather interesting. My BPD kicked in at around age 20, and that's where the shit really hit the fan. I've attempted suicide on a number of occasions; some of them being half hearted (I swallowed a packet of paracetamol and fell asleep telling myself that if I wake up, I'll go to the hospital. I did, and suffered 24 hours of sheer agony) some of them being serious. I jumped into the River Thames and nearly broke my neck, and a couple of years later I swallowed 200 rapid release oxycodones (OxyNorm). If my mother wasn't awake at 4 in the morning to read the facebook message I sent her, I would be a corpse right now. That last stunt properly fucked up my head. I managed to asphyxiate myself on vomit and I suffered some oxygen deprivation, which I think has impaired my cognitive abilities (I often forget what I'm talking about and I find it very difficult to hold a conversation). . . The way I am feeling at the moment is due to a number of factors, both acute and chronic:. . 1) I weigh 280 lbs. I've gained a shitload of weight since I lost the plot six years ago. My self-esteem is practically non-existent, which leads on to.... . 2) Nobody wants to go out with me. Hell, I've never had a girlfriend. Back in the day it was because I was deathly afraid of somehow infecting the poor girl with my badness. That, and you can't get abandoned if you're not in a relationship. I compensated for this with a fuckload of emotionally damaging casual sex. These days they want nothing to do with me. I imagine it's because I don't give a rats arse about my appearance. Who knows :/ But yeah, that shit is self inflicted so no sympathy for me on this point.. . 3) My grandmother, a person I absolutely adore and who practically raised me, has terminal cancer. This has hit me hard. Once she's gone, I don't know how I'll cope.. . 4) My idiot of a cat fell off the balcony today and fell 40 feet onto solid concrete. I love that animal more than I should admit and seeing him down there damn well near destroyed me. Thankfully, when I got down there, he seemed to be ok. I took him to the vet to be sure. . . 5) Unrequited love. Probably the most pertinent issue but... even thinking about it is triggering me now :(. . (There are a load of other long standing issues, I won't bore you with them). . Borderline Personality Disorder is a real bitch. Even a perceived slight from somebody would make me suicidal. Urgh, It's a clusterfuck. Oh yeah, and I suffer from paranoid delusions and sometimes I hear a mocking laughter coming from an external source, even though there's nobody around. Fucking brain, Y U NO WORK PROPERLY.. . Anyway, that's my piece. It was somewhat cathartic though I still feel pretty rotten.

I was admitted to the hospital for a couple of days, which scared me out of my suicidal ideations for a few weeks, but it didn't take long til I was back to where I was in the previous months. Less than a week after my attempt, my girlfriend had sex with one of my closest college friends. It wasn't completely unwarranted, because we had sort of agreed on an open relationship, but it still pissed me off, because he swore he would never do anything with her.. . I took a leave of absence from school following these events. . . I was admitted to a hospital program in November and was there daily for a month, working out my issues. I felt great there. I was happy. I had hope. Then I got out and started feeling like shit again.. . I've been back at school for about 2 weeks and I'm getting shitty grades in class.

She does not have a prescription, and no one else in my family does. She is currently away at boarding school and will not return until June. . . I don’t understand why she is so problematic, she has even had a run in with the law once before. We come from a very good family with incredible loving parents, she goes to an amazing (and extremely expensive) private boarding school (which she loves) and none of my siblings have had issues the way she has. I am getting so fed up with her, I found other things in her room before but not said anything because I don’t want to rat on her. . .

I don’t want to upset my parents or worry them, they are already dealing with their own issues. But I am scared she doesn’t understand how addictive and damaging Xanax is, nor the consequences she will run into if she is caught illegally purchasing prescription pills in this country (my father could even loose his job and residency status as a result if she is caught). But also maybe I am overreacting? She is a teenager, and we all make mistakes and are stupid at that age.

I’m so tired of TikTok (i’m probably going to delete this later) I see so many TickTock videos in the comments there’s a whole gender war going on most of the time against men but some of the arguments these girls have are so dumb but if you tell them something you get called to pick me or misogynistic which I’m just trying to be fair and recognize both genders do horrible things I saw the TikTok once  where this guy he was taking about how he wanted full custody of his  daughter because the mother wasn’t a good mom and people were like you’re just gonna rape3 her and the amount of people that liked the comment and agreed with it was concerning. . And another thing that bothers me is girls don’t get the same treatment as the man for example there was this guy he did an experiment he posted a video that said I like a girl where I sit by it and all the comments were hate from the girls but a girl posted this video before him he was just doing it the same to see people‘s reaction and all she got was praise and a few guys saying that’s body shaming but those guys who said it they just got shut down by the girls saying that’s what you guys do to us all the time and I hate when they try to justify them doing something bad by saying men do to us all the time because one there generalizing into why does it feel like nobody acknowledge that girls can be mean to you because most of the time I was in school it was amazing the boys in the meeting it was the girls who were rating guys and body shaming and doing all of that. . Some girls are just hypocrites  it also annoys me how a lot of girls over sexualized guys on like their TikTok like they all have the pregnant emoji and. say” I would get on my knees for you “I just find it so weird and then they go and complain about how guys do it to them  I’ve seen a guy do that he said under a TikTok that she was pretty she didn’t even need to make up and a bunch of girls were like she doesn’t wear to make up for you stop over sexualizing her which makes no sense I saw it as a compliment though A lot of girls to wear certain outfits and put on make up to impress guys and I’m pretty sure guys do the same sometimes,non-suicide

"Life seems bleak.As a kid growing up I've always felt like this world held potential, as an American male, born into a good home with a father and mother I had high hopes. That all dropped when my family broke up, I started living with my new step-father after I lost my house because of my father, my step-father was verbally abusive at point and made fun of me constantly. Even if it was joking a kidding, it hurt my confidence, not to add to it I had horrible acne on my face that made me a social outcast at school - I became more and more asocial day and year after year, eventually this year I began to evem start shaking when heading to school some days due to the social-anxiety I now experience. For the past 3 years I have been on-off dating a girl that has cheated on me multiple times and has still always ran back, each time I've taken her back and been angry with myself for ever loving her. I'm a genuinely good person, actually highly intelligent too and I give to people even when I don't have enough for myself - always muttering under my breath cursing myself for being nice. I recently went to a football game for school and got a bunch of items with sugar in them just to try to help cope with stress or at least suppress it - this only lead to me having a freakout and almost passing out from the speed of my heartbeat. I just feel like becoming an adult in this day and age seems bleak and unforgiving. I wish I had someone I could truely trust, as I was raised on the previous generation's morals of being a good trustworthy person, but it seems that's no longer of value in this world. I feel like I should just give up, let the depression, sadness and weakness take over. I've given up on hiding it all, it doesn't seem worth it - nothing seems worth it anymore..  .

I've struggled with depression and debilitating anxiety most of my life. I don't feel like my family really loves me, and its more of an obligation that they keep me in their lives rather than them actually wanting me around.  My parents are divorced and I'm the middle child. My siblings are all close with either my mom or my dad (2 younger on my moms side, from different fathers) (3 siblings on my dads side, 1 older, 2 younger from my dads remarriage) I never see my moms side and those siblings because they live far away, and my dads side of the family and those siblings I've lost closeness with because my stepmom and I don't get along and they have basically shut me out. I was diagnosed with autism this year at 23 years old, and being an adult woman navigating that has been excruciating. I don't feel like I belong here and I don't feel like anybody would really miss me if I was gone. I feel like I behave differently and that people don't know how to become close with me because I'm so afraid of everyone. I feel like my life was a big mistake and has just been an excruciating complicated cycle of abuse. I was raped at 12 years old and don't feel like I've ever really regained myself since then. .  I found out this year that my rapist is in prison, but will be released eventually obviously. Im terrified he will somehow find me ( which isn't all that unrealistic because he knows my name) I don't want to live in fear anymore. . .

""hey! how's it going?"". . ""Terrible. My dad has the flu and I threw up today"". . ""Aww well I hope things gets better for you"" :/. . ""It won't. My dad is immuno-compromised plus my mom has stage 40 cancer and only has 1 day to live"". . ""Oh.. umm.."". . 🛑🛑 STOP 🛑🛑. . This is a no no in conversation. Let's talk about it. I'm sure that everyone has at least witnessed this sort of situation at some point and I consider it to be a faux pas in conversation.. . The main thing you have to realize is that this conversation was meant to be a casual greeting. One of those 'see someone in the hallway; say hi as you pass' or 'have a short conversation in class' sort of deals.. . Now of course I feel bad for person B. I mean their mom has stage 40 cancer, but person A didn't sign up for all of that baggage to be put on them. What if they have baggage themselves and can't handle all of that extra?. .  When someone is feeling down, it's generally nice to give an optimistic comment or two to cheer them up, but person A has been put in a corner where they can't do that. They pretty much have to say something along the lines of ""I'm sorry for your loss."" - which chances are will ruin their mood for the rest of the day. . . Another big thing to consider is that person A did not sign up for person B's story. If person A went up to person B and said something like ""hey I've noticed you've been down recently, what's up?"" Then person B could have unloaded because A was prepared. . . **TL;DR:** as person B, don't corner someone in conversation and don't unexpectedly give them terrible news. Prepare them, or give them an 'out' in case they aren't up for it!. . ⭐⭐BETTER WAY⭐⭐. . ""Hey! How's it going?"". . ""Terrible."". . [Person A can then respond with:]. . ""Aww that's not good :/ well I hope things get better."". (Notice how they didn't specifically ask why and it would be acceptable for the convo to end here). [Person B SHOULD NOT deny A's statement and say ""it won't"" - effectively cornering person A]. . Or. . ""Aww that's not good :/ what happened?"". (They are now prepared. Have shown interest in whats wrong. Conversation will continue). . 🥕🥕If Person B corners you🥕🥕. . ""Terrible"". . ""Well I hope things get better for you"". . ""They won't. [Says terrible story]"". . ""Well I can still hope right? Even if things are looking down right now, they'll get better. Trust me. Hey I'll see you later, ok?""",non-suicide
"I can't feel. Last year I was happy, I could laugh, I could love. I don't feel anything anymore. So I tested this theory.

What do I do? How do I get over this? It’s eating me up...I’m not sure if this post belongs here but I’ve accepted that I have a problem and I need help. . . I’m 18/m and I’m a senior in highschool. I had a pretty rough break up with a girl about nine months ago. I’m the one who broke up with her. I realize that staying with her would cause a world of problems years down the road. Her family is psychotic and her brother and I do not get along. That’s beside the point that’s not why I am posting this.. . I honestly think I have been going crazy lately. She told me over the summer that her new boyfriend was so much better than me and that I did nothing for her. I’ve been grappling with this ever since she said it to me. People always say that words can’t hurt you but I think after she said that I was in the most pain I’ve ever felt. . . I feel worthless. I’m 5’4 and I’m 18 so the odds of me finding another girl are pretty slim. After I graduate I plan to go to college and I like to meet another girl but I’m worried my height is going to become a serious problem. I’m so stressed out about this I can’t even breathe. There are some nights where I wake up and have chest pains and shortness of breath. It scares me to think that I’ll never meet someone who will actually care about me and not pretend to like the last one. She met the new kid a week after we broke up and often talked about him while we dated. . . I don’t want to end up like all the early 20s people on 4chan complaining about their lives and how they can’t get a woman. I don’t know if I’ve ever really considered suicide but I am worried that if I keep thinking like this it may end up that way down the road. That girl really messed with my head and now I feel completely worthless. I know I’m a good person and I try to do the right thing.

"I am a manipulatorI always knew it. I always have known I've made undetectable suggestions to people to get what I want. I am such a piece of shit. My best friend, who I've loved for so long, is an unknowing victim of this. I would always ask him questions about himself and his life and his problems and offer emotional support at the beginning of our friendship and talk about myself very rarely.

Now I'm pretty sure he's only my friend and loves me back because I tried so hard to get him to stay in my life. He doesn't truly care, he just thinks he does. I said earlier I would never hurt him but I realize I have and he doesn't know. I don't want to do this to people anymore. He is just one example. Every day I manipulate people minorly and I know it's wrong but I can't stop. One of my ""strongest"" relationships is based on lies! Even if I do get help, I'm always going to be paranoid I manipulated them into liking me! I don't need to be around and hurt more people. It's like I used a love potion on someone and while they do show me affection, I know it's not real. I hate myself so much.. . EDIT: I have looked up the symptoms of manipulators and I've never used his ""weaknesses"" against him. I have never tried to hurt him to gain power. I have never done that to anyone actually.

"My own rules for not ending itFuck your ego. This is not a guilt trip. I’m just starting off with a reality shot. You can just not imagine the damage you do to others by ending it. You litteraly ruin all of a persons memories, inducing trauma, pain, probably ptsd to the ones you love most. You will impact everyone’s lives very very badly. The reason you suicide, that reason will ten fold into your surroundings. This is not a guilt trip. There is just no way that your pain is equal to the pain you will induce to others. My grandma said it’s like a tree of memories the deeper you go the more branches it touches. Every memory around that person. Time with others you spend. You get to have anxiety about every memorie you have. Yes every memory. If you think it is equal to what you are feeling then you are clearly too confused to think outside of your own ego into the many lives you are going to give your sorrow. And this comes from a person also thinks it is selfish from others to not let you go and impose their structures and beliefs of living on those who just want to vanish. Therefore I think you should just move to a different country or search for something else than suicide. Get white hair and be proud of being stupid. You literally can just go. Do anything. Nothing is keeping you if the alternative is suicide. Anything. I have some funny stories based around this concept as well. Doing something other people don’t like but you want to do is a way better option than the alternative. Fuck others everyone is egocentric anyway nobody remembers you in 10 years if you keep distance. Except when it’s suicide... That thing that people will laugh about now, that crazy thing you did, nobody will remember it in 10 years unless you want them to. So make new connections. Go live your best life. Or try and communicate better and make things better which is always the premium option but not always viable. This comes from a man with ADD, RAD, PTSD (so depression, anxiety, flashbacks all of the shit for 10 years), white hair and a degree for staying in bed for weeks on end. I went to have a sensual erotic massage in a parlor a couple of weeks ago and got jerked off by a random lady. This sounds nasty and I did think it kinda was. But you know what it made everyone laugh including myself and made me being able to laugh at myself again. Fuck everything. If it’s not bringing you closer to dying like eating too much or picking up smoking again then anything you do is great. I’d recommend staying healthy to see opportunities coming and feel your emotions better. Not that I’m good at this but it will already change your life if you focus on just this. Your brain needs fuel to start with. You can’t give a plant piss instead of water and be like wauw strange that it’s not thinking ahead and only think about death?! Super strange. If you think there is no point to anything and we are all just little specs. This is true but if there is no point to anything then there is also no reason to not be stupid and go for what you like. There is always something you like as well. You have dopamine receptors and while some parents smoke through pregnancy, you still have them and they do light up with certain things. So claiming it doesn’t is just you not being honest to life, or you are just really really unhealthy. Try shit out. Be a fool. Anything is more than being dead. The anxiety you feel and pressure is your head, if you do not like others pressuring you then 1 or you are not able to communicate well and tell them to fuck off in a nice way so they incorporate what you are saying. Or 2 you have to distance yourself because trying to convert to other peoples opinion of life is actually disrespectful to them, cause you are letting them slowly fade with you, not giving them the perspective they need in order to understand you. Also don’t forget humans are dumb even if you demand respect which is not the best way to get it but sometimes necessary as you are not good with boundaries , it might click two years later why they mistreated you. You can’t hold people on their thought processes they have now. Allow others room like you want and need right now yourself. Allow others to grow but that does not mean you have to be with them when they do. So, be a fool. Be whatever you want. Not being is the greatest crime.",suicide

A week or so ago I realised that I seemed to have made progress, despite failing to find effective help.

"death is all I think abouttoday I thought about jumping in front of a car, slitting my wrists, jumping off one of my school buildings that's tall enough. I think of new ways to die every day. My GPA went to shit last fall during a major depressive episode and I added an extra year of university because of it. I am forced to work minimum wage jobs and I can't really pursue my short term dreams because I'm too busy. I don't feel like I fit in anywhere because I'm just too aware. Only a few people care about me and I figure the earlier I die the better so I don't hurt anyone else. Today I missed two big assignments because I'm an idiot and didn't check past the five I completed on time. I am sick of believing I can be something and achieve goals when I'm nothing and do not matter. I simply can not fathom a world where I do anything but continue to abhor life itself. Grad school seems impossible. Working in any of the industries I want to work is impossible. I was told all my life I'm gonna be someone because I have talent, or good personality or I'm a good person. but all I want to do is sleep. I'm not good enough to continue living. my life is but a small drop in the collective concious. work might miss me bc they will need to fulfill a position. school wouldn't care and I'd probably get a news article and a memorial from people that never cared about me but I them. my family would be hurt but would be motivated to do better I hope. they never believed in therapy or medication so thanks I guess. my few friends would miss me but I hope they would continue to do their art and do good for me. I just don't agree with this world. how we fight to make money and how you need money for everything. how GPA is really all that matters if you wanna move forward. how chemistry and bio are worth more than happiness. how nothing matters when you want to die. even when I fight like all the great anime heros to stay alive.

"I don't know why I want to kill myself so bad but I doHi, I was going to write this yesterday, but I was feeling muddleheaded. I will introduce myself, my name is Matthew, and I am 15, almost 16. I guess it all started back in the fall of 2011. In the summer, we just moved to Germany (my dad works for the government), and I was about to start school. I started into the 9th grade and went there for about a month, just over 4 weeks. Every day it got harder, I didn't know what exactly, but everything just seemed to crash in. One day I couldn't take it, and I told my mom. Another week past, and we decided that I was going to be homeschooled (online classes, really), for the rest of 9th grade. Homeschooling was terrible and throughout that whole year I wanted to kill myself, but I didn't know why. To many I had the dream life. Then last summer, (summer of 2012), I was done with homeschooling. we went to the states, and then came back to Germany about august 10th. I started 10th grade at another school. On the first day I knew I wasn't going to be able to take it anymore. On the second day of school, in the morning, I tried telling my mom and dad, but they wouldn't listen, they kept yelling at me to get ready and go. In the shower, I cut my wrist (I didn't have to get any stitches), and my mom took me to the local physiatrist. I told him I really wanted to kill myself. The next day (about august 19th, 2012), me and mom flew to the U.S. (I live in Germany, remember?). I was put in a mental hospital for 9 hours of the day. I did that for about a week. Next I took several mental and physiological tests that took about 2-3 months. Here were my results: they said I had very minor learning disabilities such as slow reading and other really low key stuff. They also said I have an anxiety disorder. Next, they sent me back to Germany. I have to see a therapist every week. We made a plan about how I wont have feelings to kill myself, I went back to 9th grade because of all the school I missed in the states, and I was sent back with HALF the course load of a normal 9th grader to lower my anxiety and my stress. I started about 4 weeks ago. I went and did school for 2 weeks, had my winter break, did it for another 4 days, and here I am wanting so badly to kill myself. I don't know why I want to kill myself so badly, but I know I really need to. Sometimes I try to think, ""nothing is wrong, your safe, you have a lot of money, you have barely any school"", but it doesn't work I always come back with plans of slitting my wrist in a warm bath with an exacto knife, or jumping off my apartment building head first, or jumping into a subway train, or straight up stabbing myself. Its 4:40 AM right now, and im fucked for tomorrow. What do I do? if I tell my mom that I want to kill myself, she will either 1; wont believe me and make me go to school, in which case I have no idea what to do, or 2; send me to the therapist, and she will make us go to the states again in the mental hospital. and boy I hated the mental hospital. . . I don't know why I feel so depressed, I have nothing to worry about. I try to believe that but I always want to kill myself. I feel so worthless, I don't even know what I believe anymore. although I don't think im going insane, I can think straight. im not having any hallucinations or anything like that.. . Anyway, someone please tell me what to do. im out of options at this point. I suppose I can fake that im sick until the weekend, but then what? please tell me.",suicide

I wish I saw death as a way out, but I see it as a continuation of existence through eternity. So I don’t even have the hope of a possible escape. I tried suicide last year. I survived, obviously, and realize now that I was trying to make a statement rather than find a way out. Because there is no way out.

"I don’t belong here and I’m pretty confident that it’s my time to go.This is certainly going to be a LONG post and I already know it won’t get seen by many which is ok. I know I’ll sound pathetic at times too. I just want to share why Ive decided to end it. I’m using this more as a place to get my thoughts out for when I write a better letter for my mom. As much as I wish I could just end it I feel like there should be some sort of explanation as to why I did it.  I apologize if it is hard to read or gets unorganized. I also want it to be known that I’m not angry at anyone or anything and it is nobody’s fault. I’m just tired of being alone all of the time. . . Currently I’m an 18 year old male freshman in college. My life has only gotten darker over the past few years. I’ve never been someone who has had a bunch of friends. I’ve had some friends come and go throughout my years at school. I participated in sports from K-11th grade. I don’t think I’ve ever done anything to where anyone hated me but I’ve never had many friends. I was the one who sat alone at lunch and struggled to find people for group projects. I just never fit in with any group. It probably didn’t help that I’m more introverted. I struggle to have the confidence  to just go up and talk to people without feeling like I’m a burden or interrupting. It also doesn’t help that I’m super slow to open up to new people. That’s why people who know me well will describe me differently from people who just met me. However if someone approached me I was always thrilled and gave them my attention. I’m someone who is a good listener and am better 1 on 1 with people or smaller groups. I like being around people but I just can’t seem to connect with people my age. I’ve always struggled to make friends for some reason and it hurts. It doesn’t help that I have self esteem and confidence issues. I never was invited to go do things with people and I never attended events at school because I didn’t have friends. I think part of it could’ve been because I was more quiet and I don’t drink or smoke. I always thought it would get better. From middle school to high school and then from high school to college. I realize now that it’ll never get better. I’ve just never belonged to a group or a friend. I just don’t understand though because it’s so weird. I’m great with people older than me by about 5 or more years so 23 and up or people younger than me. My neighbors in their 40s were cool to be around, I have friends with parents in their 50s and I do well with them. I get along well with seniors 65 and up well. Pretty much all age groups aside from my own. Maybe it’s because they can see me for me and they aren’t worried about a popularity contest? They don’t automatically know I’m a loser and loner at school? I just don’t get why this is the case for me. Same thing for gaming. I play some games online and I’ve made some friends through online gaming and it’s great because they get to know me for me. I don’t understand why I am better at making friends outside my age group and online compared to my own age group.. . I’ve never had a girlfriend. I’ve tried working out, I’ve done well in school, I’ve always maintained good hygiene regardless of how depressed I am, I’ve worked a full time job in the summers, I feel like I’m a nice person to everyone but it’s never been enough. I’m not trying to be the self proclaimed nice guy here, but my mom has consistently had other parents and teachers tell her how respectful and kind I am throughout school. I try to be helpful to others if they seem like they are struggling. For example, if we had to partner up or group up in classes, I’d look to see if there were other people struggling to find people because I know what it feels like. Just stuff like that. Sure I certainly have down moments that might now reflect so good on my character. I’m just saying I feel like I try my best to be a thoughtful, caring, honest, decent person. Sorry for the tangent. Anyways like I said I’ve never had a girlfriend. I am just so ugly I don’t even try to make a move anymore. I’m just a skinny, glasses wearing, guy with a soft voice who is unattractive. I get it. I’ve come to terms with no matter how hard I try I can’t change that and I’d be single as long as I continue living. I’ll never forget the time a girl called me ugly to my face and laughed. It’s that kind of stuff that can cripple any self confidence that somebody had left. Obviously nobody is obligated to be attracted to me or be in a relationship with me. It just hurts seeing people in relationships knowing they have someone. I’m tired of going through life alone. I wish I had someone to share experiences with and to do things with. Someone to hold. I am so touch and socially deprived honestly now. At college I have no friends on my campus. Some days I hardly talk to anyone like literally. I’m sure there’s days where I don’t utter a word. My mom has never been a big hugger so I don’t get much physical affection. At this point I hug a pillow to sleep because it somewhat simulated being close to a person. I used to be able to pet and hug my pets at home but now I’ve been at campus for months and haven’t seen them.. . I just don’t feel like I have a purpose. I study and work most days and when I’m done I never have anything to look forward to. No girlfriend or friends to look forward to hanging out with, no pets to be around. It all feels pointless. I don’t care enough about myself anymore to do it for me. I don’t know how I’m getting the grades I am my first year. I feel like I’m hardly giving as much effort. I won’t be able to maintain As for much longer if I don’t find a way to motivate myself. It happened in high school. I got worse over time because I stopped giving max effort. I got off to a great start in college because I was finally excited because I thought it would be a fresh start but I was wrong, I’m still a loner.. . I don’t think anybody truly cares about me. I already shared that I have no friends or girlfriend. I don’t see extended family very often. My mom is good but I think she’d get over it. I’ve tried surviving for my pets, love of music, sports and games. My pets are probably the number one thing that have kept me going but I don’t seem them anymore and they’d also probably be fine without me. I’ve always loved waiting for my favorite artists to release new music. I listen to a variety of music and it is something that is normally able to help me escape my bad thoughts. I’ve always thought that I wouldn’t get to hear what they release next if I kill myself but my thoughts and feeling outweighs that mindset now. Nothing really makes me happy anymore. I don’t have much to look forward to as I said earlier. My main point is that my passing wouldn’t affect anyone too bad and I say that confidently.. . As of right now I don’t have the courage to do it. I still don’t know how I’ll do it. I’ve recently come to this decision even though I’ve considered it before. I don’t know how long it’ll take me to do it. I’m hoping in the next couple of months I’ll be able to do it. As I’ve said I only get lonelier and any hope I had before is pretty much gone. . . I would just like to leave everyone with one thing. I know this might be difficult because most people who read this are either struggling or trying to help others, but try to have some kindness and empathy towards others. If you notice someone by themselves or struggling to be a part of a group try to be nice to them or invite them. You don’t know how much you could change somebody. I mean that for real. It would’ve meant and still would mean everything to me if someone just invited me to be a part of an activity or sit next to them or just talk. Sure some might be odd and you don’t have to hang out with them again if you don’t want but just try to give people a shot. Some people just might be shy or be nervous to approach new people especially if they are already in a group. Again you could change someone and make them feel happiness. You could give them something to look forward to. If not then I just advise you to please be careful to what you say to certain people. Some people are going through tough times and are struggling mentally. Just try to be kind.. . One more thing. What happens to my belongings and money afterwards? Is there a way I can make sure a specific person gets those? Can I make a will to a random person I haven’t seen in a while?",suicide

It's not that I think things will get better or that I feel like I'm worth saving. I don't actually know why I'm holding off.

Usually, I feel good knowing that I am more considerate than a lot of other people. Not in a holier than thou type of way but just I think I'm a good person. Well what has that got me. I try and be considerate of others feelings and just get hurt. I am so angry but I don't have the guts or will to hurt anyone else emotionally (definitely not physically). So I feel like I want to die to spite everyone. My parents who beat me and pressured me and made me so scared of being alone, the people who have abandoned me, and the people who have used me. I stopped thinking about how it would make my parents sad if I died. I know it would, but I want them to be in pain because my parents made me this way. I just don't want to be alone. If I am dead, I won't ever have to worry about that ever again. I don't care if I'll burn in hell. I don't believe in it and I'll take that chance that it doesn't exist. . . &amp;#x200B;. . all I want is to not feel so alone.",suicide

This isn’t about me but I didn’t know anywhere else to postI was with a girl the other night and she seemed perfectly normal to me and didn’t seem to have many signs of depression. We ended up casually hooking up not giving ages but I’m on the younger side of things and I noticed scars all up and down her thighs and lower butt. Some looked to be very old but they were very deep. I just feel horrible and I don’t know what to do. We ended up just making out and cuddling because she has not done many things with a guy. I just rubbed her legs as she fell asleep but I could not sleep because of how sorry I felt for her. I know this isn’t based around suicide but these cuts were DEEP and if any of them were cut at the same time she would have been losing major blood. I’d like to bring it up but I feel like it would make her uncomfortable as we are friends but not to the point where I could bring that up.,suicide

"My Final Goodbye. A Letter.Tonight is the night my entire life has lead up to. After this is sent out to my few friends, family, and associated social media accounts, I plan to bleed myself out in the tub. My elavil has stopped working and I'm left with no other solutions. Hanging myself like my mom did feels too much like a slap in the face toward her and I've always been afraid that a gun would miss and leave me more scarred than before. This is the only way that feels right. There are a lot of things I've been grateful for, don't get me wrong. I love my dad, my brother, my sisters, and my step mom so much. They've always been supportive of me. They accepted my sexuality, they tried to get me therapy when it was needed, they've done so many wonderful things for me. I've gotten to meet my biggest idols, I've been sung directly to by my favorite singer, I've been to Disney more times than I can count. It probably doesn't make sense why I feel so down even though my home life is amazing. But there are some things I haven't told you all. I've been torn down, outcast, emotionally abused, sexually harassed and more. I'm at a stage in my life where presenting myself as normal to the public just isn't possible anymore. I can barely function and instead of getting the assistance with things from non-family members that I need, I was punished for not keeping up. There's one more person in this message that I haven't mentioned yet. You betrayed me more times than I can count. You lied to me my entire life then fucked me over when I needed you the most. This blood is on your hands. You know who you are.. . Goodbye, I'll miss you all.",suicide

I cannot stay around into October. I must find a way out. I had my chance and blew it. I am so disappointed in myself. Partial suspension seems the 'painless' way out but I have not had any success in achieving unconsciousness from test runs. Short drop looks the only way to go but will be very uncomfortable for an unknown amount of time. I don't want to jump in front of a train as it will mean involving innocent people which I do not want. I am hurting, I am fed up of taking medication from doctors that don't work. I just want out.

"I don't know what to doI feel like such a selfish little brat for being this miserable over nothing. I'm an 18 year old female, and I'm in my freshmen year of college. . . My family's pretty poor, and I have a 17 year old brother about to enter college as well. So I opted to go to a huge and relatively cheap public university in my home city, and live at home as well. . . It's been *awful*. My family life was pretty rough before college started. My father and I haven't gotten along in some time. When I was a child he was the best father you could ever want. Then he got really, really hurt.. . One of the injuries was head trauma that really changed his personality. He's also an alcoholic, and very controlling.. . I was hoping that once I started college I'd be given a little more freedom, but it's been the opposite. My life has become very limited, I'm really not allowed to leave my house except for school, nor am I allowed to get a job (he's sabotaged a couple attempts I've made) And any interaction I have with him usually results in a. . I know I *could* leave, but I don't even know what I'd do. And he scares me, he could ruin my entire existence if he wanted to. There's more to this, but it's not even worth talking about. . . College is not going well. I've always been pretty good at  school, I'm an alright writer. However, I feel like I'm paying an awful lot of money to not really do anything. I don't know what I want, but I don't like just taking filler classes for this much money a year. . . I used to be a pretty vivacious person, but lately my old fears and anxieties have come back with a vengeance. The worst of which is severe, debilitating test anxiety. Not only do I fail every test or quiz I take, but I completely blank out and occasionally have panic attacks or write gibberish that makes no sense because my mind goes into a wild panic and I come up with these insane, irrelevant ideas. . . I went to my school's counselors to discuss my anxiety issues, but they didn't really offer me any kind of help or solutions. They just gave me a list of therapists that accept my family's insurance. . . I called a couple but I didn't really make an appointment. I tried to, but they just told me they'd call me back and never did. I'm also afraid of seeking therapy or anything because my dad's really against it, he'd freak out  at me if he knew. . . I also have no friends. The only people I regularly talk to are my mother and my boyfriend. My mother's too depressed and downtrodden by my father to do much else besides listen to me, and I think my boyfriend's getting tired of me being a sad sack of shit all the time. . . My few friends from high school smartly moved away for college and are having a much better time than I am. I'm not really in contact with any of them. I hoped I'd make new friends in college, but I'm kind of out of the loop, because most first year students live on campus and I just couldn't afford it. Apparently you make your friends in the dorms first. I usually end up spending my time in school alone reading books or on my computer. I don't know how to approach people, and I've regressed and become very timid. . . There's more, but I already feel sick writing all this stupid nonsense. I don't deserve to be this upset, but I've been crying all day today and I can't stand it. I don't want to live like this anymore. I *can't* live like this anymore. I'm actually kind of worried for myself, but I'm too afraid to tell anyone I know, and the few people I could tell can't really help me at this point. . .

"I need helpHello everyone, I have been a long time lurker and decided to finally write a post. . . I know there’s something wrong with me, however I don’t know what it is. Ever since I can remember I have a really hard time being happy, I’m always in a bad mood on the verge of tears. I have been through a lot in life, my mom abandoned me when I was very small and recently tried to come back into my life saying she found God and needed my forgiveness, mind you I’m 30’years old. I have a son who is my life and world, his father was never involved. I met someone in a different country and moved to said country to be with this someone, to fill that void. He is a father to my son and loves him unconditionally... my fathers biological son was abusive and put me in the hospital several times. I just feel I can never quite get over my mom and my sons father, I feel like they killed me and somehow I am still alive. I went to therapy a while back and I was diagnosed as severely depressed and prescribed clonozepam and Wellbutrin. My now husband is aware of my pain and past, I told him about feeling depressed and he is very antiquated .. he says I’m depressed because I want to be. We are in constant fights, I cry everyday and one day he just said if I wanted to be ok with him I had to stop taking medicine so he threw my meds away.. that was 4 months ago... I stopped cold turkey. . . I try to be happy, I really do.. but there’s always something on my mind and I find myself feeling angry and extremely sad.. I try to hide behind a smile... I constantly google symptoms and obviously I cannot diagnose myself, but I feel I am anti social, depressed, anxious, suicidal and Bi polar.. I just feel like the only reason to live is my son.. my husband is not supportive and expects me to be happy all the time, I try so hard but I just can’t! I get along fine with his family, but being in a different country makes me go crazy! They’re so different from me.. I thrive career wise and have goals in mind, but I just feel useless...  my son is a happy boy and I feel that if I divorce he will suffer tremendously since this is the only. Family he knows.. I feel like I want a divorce but I just cannot are my son suffer .. help.. I drink wine constantly and take benadryls at night to end my thoughts..

"My theory is everyone is depressedI'm sick of trying to convince people that I'm legitimately struggling. People get angry when you open up about your issues. They immediately combat your feelings with their trauma. I can't even get a sentence out with out someone immediately saying ""well, my life is fucked because blah blah blah so you should be fucking over joyed!"". Okay, I get it you're miserable. Why can't we *BOTH* be miserable? Why is it that they have this preconceived notion that I'm not allowed or capable of feeling as bad as they do or worse? I'm a firm believer in environmental factors being the cause of addiction and mental illness. Anyone who disagrees is most likely saving face so they don't have to confront the reality that they themselves may be ill or contributing to someone's illness. I would hate to leave my loved ones broken from my death, but at this point in my life I really feel like everyone is so absorbed in their own issues that they don't have the capacity to understand. I'm not asking for money or things. I'm asking for a genuine conversation where I can let out my fears and frustrations and have someone be able to listen with out immediately denying what I'm saying. I can't even finish my thought and they say they don't understand me. They wouldn't be better off if I was dead but they're not good with me here. I'm seriously stuck. I don't want anyone to say ""oh I'm so sorry"". I simply just want someone to be like ""yeah this fucked, but we can relate on it being fucked"". Instead people want to compete and keep everything separate. Were all humans and we a generally feel the same shit. So stop acting like so and so doesn't get you because they fucking do.

But in fact all relationships are total sucks that are based on mutual manipulation. And the truth is that people are realy realy sucks. You will finaly discover so much shit in your romantic partner that you will not like it at all. Maybe you are lucky that you have no atttactice apperiance , it saves you from annoying exhausting romances and disappointments of the annoying thing that cals love. in fact life in general is the greatest dissapointment . And things look nice only from a distance. The best thing that one can get from live is to live in some lofty solitude without engagement in the dirt of life.

"I cant take it anymoreI have been experiencing suicidal thoughts ever since my dad died when I was 7. Then I got into middle school and everyone I talked to made me feel like I was just a piece of shit who deserved to die. Then I met some girl online and we had so much in common, and after months of talking I found out I loved her. My parents then found out I was talking to a random stranger. They made me cut of all contact with her. She told me where she lived before we lost contact. So the next day I ditched school and ran. A couple days later I got caught by the police. They brought me back home and my parents shamed me. I went back to school the following Monday and everyone new about me running away. I would get called names nonstop. The girl who I talked to also happened to be suicidal and being made fun of in school. I just thought how she could be dead right now. Now I'm in high school and I still get treated like absolute shit. I have decided that as soon as my dog dies I an going to end it all since I know no one will even give two shits.",suicide
"Can things ever get better?I have ADHD, mild tinnitus and mild hyperacusis. I'm suspecting I have anxiety and maybe dysthymia as well.

Anxiety, tinnitus and the hyperacusis was full blown and I had a headache as well. I slept a little to rest and I woke up after 4 hours. That the fuck is the point? I've talked to my family about suicide and are terrified and say that they would be ruined and I believe them. I'm going to talk to my psychiatrist and see what's going on on tuesday, but it feels like it is game over. I just can't handle me being so broken. I feel like I'll never be fixed.

Maybe if they had intervened and got me help before I had anxiety, tinnitus and hyperacusis, but what the fuck is the point now? I don't want to point fingers but my I feel my parents were really negligable. I feel like I would just do them a favor if I offed myself. I've heard steroids can help with anxiety and mood so I've thougt about doing it to get back into training. I don't think my psychiatrist would ever allow me but I'm not convinced SSRI's are more beneficial or more safe, I feel it's more fear mongering than anything. I need to leave urine tests when I visit my psychiatrist so they'll know for sure I'm not a drug addict.. . How long do I need to use SSRI's? Is it forever?

"Just Getting this off my Chest.I'm not suicidal...nor am I any danger of killing myself but I often think about it and I often see it in the media. I was spurred on to make this post and try to discuss my current problem after seeing the episode of Family Guy where Brian and Stewie got locked in the bank vault and Brian admits he thinks about killing himself because his life has no meaning.  Oddly enough, I can relate and worse still I know I could never go through with it because I would be proving everyone in my life right and just end up another statistic that some sick bastard would use to make their political agenda fit whatever narrative they wanted to bring up.. . And I know where all of this shit in my life stems from. I know where the depression comes from, I know where my feelings of inadequacy and inability to even know what love or happiness feels like anymore came from. It all came from my mother. . . I grew up in the Southern States to an moderately affluent family, nothing in the 1%er range more between 180k to 200k combined a year depending on the overtime my father worked or company bonuses my mother gained. My father was an educated male from the baby boomer generation who never went to college and started work at a factory and eventually made manager; my mother was college educated, got a master's and while she loves my father is so married to her career that she no longer separates from her life. She's one of the heads of security for a nuclear power plant and controls a lot of employees.. . When I was little, it wasn't so bad but my parents were very authoritarian and it wasn't uncommon for myself, a child that they thought had ADHD thanks to a food allergy to red-dye that made me hyperactive, but I eventually grew out of, to be beaten or spanked. I cut my own switches, face soaked with tears as I didn't even understand what I did wrong or why I was behaving the way I was. I screamed in pain as only a 6-9 year old boy can when my father took a leather belt more than inch thick to my backside. . . It got worse as I went into schooling and while I was thankfully taken to a psychiatrist and medical professional who kept my parents from medicating me and giving me a more selective diet it didn't stop my teachers from giving them 'behavioral grades' on a daily basis. If I got anything below a B I was spanked. I remember several days at school as a child where I had been spanked by my mother or father that the day after I couldn't sit comfortable at all. My little baby ass was almost perptually bruised during that time of my life and even as they did this. My mother would constantly tell me, ""no one will ever you love you like we do. No one."". . I bought into it, thought my parents were telling the truth, that their form of love was the best and it would never get any better. I began to associate the pain with affection but I always felt cold and empty. Next came the days of actual learning and challenge in school, when they asked well what do you want to be. Of course I got the speil about I could be anything I wanted to be and being from a very religious family, I was told that God had put me on this planet for a very, very special reason.. . I could never figure out that reason. I never knew what I wanted to do and frequently changed my ideas. I used to want to make video games, to entertain people and make up magnificent stories. I was usually told that I could do it, but it was silly and meaningless. I was constantly pushed towards engineering but eventually went to college for a communications degree. . . Yet, the idea that I was meant to be something more always stuck with me, but my overly religious upbringing and the fact that my parents raised me more than 10 miles away from the next house beyond my Grandparents meant I was officially isolated from the outside world beyond school hours for more than 8 years. You know...the years where most social skills and learning habits develop?. . I grew up socially stunted, constantly compared to my much older and social butterfly of a brother. I didn't date and was constantly questioned and even threatened about my sexuality. I was unable to choose if I was a churchgoer or not and constantly rammed from service to service, mission trip to mission trip and ostracized from the other children by age because I was never around. I was the outsider, the person they didn't know about.. . At school it was much the same, I wasn't to be associated with. I was the unknown and bounced from one side of the city to the other, never able to make a reperior with anyone until I finally got into High school. It's only now that I look back that I realize I was just an object of convenience for those friends as well.  I was bullied and beaten by my peers until I hit a growth spurt in earlier high school and joined the football team. I got larger, more muscular and attractive and gained a 'family' in the form of the team from an outside prospective. In reality I had just traded one set of abusers for another. My teammates often molested me, fought with me and would do everything in their power to make the couches punish me in some fashion. Most of the couches knew it was going on but allowed it for team cohesion. . . By the way, I don't mean they just spanking my ass. I mean my teammates would bear hug me while they were naked and rub their genitals against my body. Many would grab my testicles and play with them or act like they were jerking me off in the middle of changing. It was all a big joke to them and when it's 1 on 40 you tend to just let it happen so you don't lose your teeth. I had already stood up for myself once in middle school for the same behavior from the football team. I ended up in the hospital with a major concussion when I was tombstoned into the floor of the lockerroom and left alone, screaming in pain as I went blind from the impact and couldn't even move my legs. I crawled dumbly across the floor, crying like a bitch because I couldn't even make my toes move until I finally got through the door by some miracle and a couch got me up from my feet to sit me down and wait for an ambulance. I saw a picture later, there was so much blood on my face and body that it looked like someone had cut me open from the middle of my stomach to the crown of my head.. . It's been many years, but I still remember that the only punishment the team received was extra exercises for the week.. . I remembered back then, knowing that i would never be the physical specimens of many of them and most of my bullies, I just remembered thinking that I show them with my brain, that I'd excel and make something and make more money and do something special. I'm in the work force now, 1000 miles from home, working for an older, more narciassistic version of my mother, publishing bullshit pseudo-science I don't believe onto social media and writing their copy and advertisements for them and I know that I'm a failure at life.  Not because I didn't try and not because I made bad choices, but because myself and so many others were doomed to fail from the start.. . We're abused and battered and shown time and time again that people who are born certain ways or in certain places are just better than us and can abuse us because of that fact. We're shown it with people who are born into money, we're shown it with people who are born with more athetic talent or with anyone who has more sex appeal or anything else that makes them 'special' to the rest of the world. . . It hit me how true it was in college and it's stuck with me since. Since leaving school, I've been sexually harassed by co-workers at more than 3 employers at least a dozen if not more times. In college, I was raped by a 'female friend' who I had trusted and got me too intoxicated to turn her down. She then privately spread anonymous images of my junk across the campus and complained about my 'inability to perform' to several other people on campus, creating a wide spread rumor mill and killing any ability I had to find a signifcant other.  Campus claimed they couldn't track down the origin and that I ""Shouldn't complain about the incident even if it did happen."". . I thought moving across the country would help, but I ended up in a soul crushing location, grinding day after day and doing the same thing at work. While my all-female co-workers treat me like a beast of burden, blame every mistake in the company on me and act as if my presence is a sin. Day after day I'm reminded that I'm an 'other' in the office, but I have no where to go anymore.  I can't return home since my family told me I was not welcome in the house hold anymore now that I was old enough to support myself and I don't have the money to just quit my job and start a new job hunt. I continue looking for jobs but it's the same thing that most people suffer from still. ""Not enough applicable experience."" for even the most basic of positions. . . I know this got overly long and ranty, since I spent the better part of twenty minutes writing this. It made me feel better at least.",suicide

"Medication withdrawals are making me suicidal-where to go for help? I started a long drawn out process of getting off lamictal many months ago. I'm super dependent on it to not be depressed and have been on it for almost 4 years now, so I've been going down 6.25 mg at a time and lowering every 10 days. Lamictal gave me a serious illness that now is attacking my organs, so I have to quit no matter what.. . Nothing has ever helped me not be depressed besides lamictal, and I don't really feel I can have a life without it. My psychiatrist cares a ton and is very invested in her patients and has regular conference calls with my therapist, she's very sweet. But after so many tries to get on other things, I'm not okay...I'm on 56.25 mg now and have been for a month. I can't go down because the depression will get even worse, and I can't go up because the last time I raised it by just 6.25 I had a fever and increased autoimmune issues for 10 weeks. I'm suicidal and scared of being in my mind. Is it worth going to a psychiatric hospital? I feel like I'm in crisis/psychiatric emergency mode all the time, but I'm not sure if that's the place to go to get help coming off and get on better meds.",suicide
"I wanna die but I'm not brave enough to commit suicideI want to die. And this thought comes to me almost every day. I'm a girl, I'm 20. Everything is fine in my life.

I'm not bullied, or discriminated, forced to anything, I'm not going through any hard stuff.. But it's been more than ten years that I feel this bad. That I have suffocating and weeping crisis on the floor almost everyday. That sometimes I hate myself so much that I throw up after looking in the mirror. That I know I'm completely empty. That even if I seem to have fun, after I know that it wasn't sincere. That I have no passion. No lead in my life. That I not even sure to love my family. That I've never fell in love or had any crush. That I've been incapable of having sex. I had once and it was complete indifference. That I have no dreams, no imagination, no memories. That I disgust myself for being so selfish. That I feel like I fantasize my own grief. I'm exhausted.. Wrote myself a letter 5 years ago for when I'll be 20. Just confirms what I already knew; nothing has changed except that know I don't have the perspective of adolescence anymore. I suffer so much over void, and I'm not even sure this suffering is genuine.. I know what I think is wrong, I'm the first to say that every human being is valuable, deserve love etc...

"I don’t know how to get the help I needI posted here a few days ago from a separate account. The short version of everything is I tried to kill my self a month ago today, failed pathetically, ended up in a psych ward for 6 days and thought I was doing better. Not completely but I thought I was on the right track. For the past 2 weeks though it’s been building and I had a plan to kill myself Friday but I got through the night.. . I called hotlines and texted them all week and for the past 4-5 days it’s been everyday, sometimes multiple times a day. Nothing seems to be helping and keeping me safe. I told my best friend on Thursday night, promised not to do it then obviously had a change of heart. Told her again on Friday night out of guilt and she made me feel selfish (which is good I suppose) to the point where it delayed me doing it. Also talked to a hotline that night 3 times. . . My best friend vowed to help me even though I told her she shouldn’t have to and I feel absolutely horrible, like I’m making her. But also the idea of receiving help from her is reassuring and I want it. Nothing has happened yet though and it’s 2 days later. I know nothing will change immediately but I was hoping for some more support from her, like maybe just her texting me first instead of me desperately hoping she will text me back and not be too busy. We haven’t talked all day, we usually talk daily. . . Basically my plan has only been delayed until tomorrow night, with the hopes of anything good happening to stop me within the time frame between now and then. I don’t know how to get this help from my friend that she promised and I don’t know how to get help from these hotlines. Any advice would be great. I don’t trust myself to stop myself. . . And yeah. I know I’m being selfish and probably looking for attention from my friend and I’m sorry. I hate myself for that. I don’t know how to stop any of this on my own though. ",suicide

"Did I do the right thing?The other night I was wasting my time on campus until a Christmas concert started. I sat in the lounge outside the food court watching Breaking Bad on my laptop- I know, Breaking Bad, good call. I looked up for a split second and saw my friend Mike. He was walking by with our mutual friend John because they were about to study for an exam together. I called out to him and we began conversing. I don't remember what was said, just that Mike responded, ""First I have to see if I let myself survive the night."". . Mike has always had a dark sense of humor, but I had noticed that since the start of the semester something about him had changed and he was no longer happy with anything. John laughed off the comment as they walked off to study. I, however, just sat there and returned to watching Breaking Bad, but I couldn't get what he said out of my head. What if he wasn't joking? So I texted him and the conversation went as follows:. (G= me, M=Mike). . . G= Hey bud, don't joke about suicide I don't take that lightly.. . M= Never said I was joking. . G= Dude. You serious?. . M= Leave it alone. I'm just tired.. . G= No I'm not going to leave it alone. You're talking about suicide. This is not something I'm dropping.. . M= Shut up before you push something.. . G= Where are you at?. .      I haven't told anyone. I need you to talk to me or I'm gonna have     .      to start telling people so that we can find you. (At this point I did .      not know if he was still with John or not.). .     This would include police.. . M= G, you do not want to mess with me now. I will beat the shit out of you if you come close. Leave me alone and let me work. Go home. I don't want your help now. I don't need you to be here. I can handle my own shit without loading it on other people. Goodnight, I'll talk to you later. . G= The[n] beat the shit outta me if it helps you. I'm not leaving till I know you're ok.. . M= I I'm great. Leave.. . G= (I don't use language unless quoting someone. Mike knows this and I thought maybe if I used language he would see that I'm serious.) What the fuck do you thin[k] you're doing. This isn't funny. I'm sorry I give a fuck, but you can't change that. And if you pull some stupid shit, I don't want it to be because I went home.. . M= Don't cuss sweeties you're not good at it. . G= This isn't funny at this point. Let me talk to you.. .     Be in the lobby on the floor or I will inform [the dorm] employees and break into your room.. . M= G. I'm a bit too busy for this right now. Have a nice night. I'm fine. If I have to I will block you from my phone and Facebook to stop the repeated annoyance of this evening. I'm not having a great time and you are making [it] alot[sic] worse so please stop because it's not funny, you're not helping and I didn't want your help to begin with. You are in every way intruding on my happiness at this moment. Stop that. . .     I'm working on finals with John. Leave.. . G= I'm not leaving campus till we talk. I'll sleep here if I have to. Text me when you're done.. . M= Have fun haha. . At this point I realized I would be better served if I went home and gave his mom a call. So I went back to my house and tracked down the number. I called and told her that Mike had mentioned suicide and seemed very upset and aggravated about something. She said she would call him. I don't know what was said between them, but about an hour later I got this text from him: ""We're done. I don't know you. You don't know me."". . About twenty minutes later another friend texted me saying I was stupid and that Mike was on a suicide watch list now.

The weight of the world is heavy on my chest, and I want so badly to give in. I just don't want to hurt anyone else with my choices. I'm convinced that there is no hope for a better life. I can't afford help, because I have no job, because I'm depressed and socially anxious. I feel like I'm in a cruel cycle of not being able to get the help I need, but unwilling to end it all if it means someone else will have to find me. Life is far too cruel as it is. I don't want to end up being nothing more than something my loved ones have to clean off of a wall and try to distract themselves from when they see just the wrong shade of red. Every day the thought is in my mind. I look at things in my surroundings and think about how practical it would be if that were my weapon of choice. It's like I'm essentially shopping for the method I'm going to use to kill myself. I'm still making plans. Constantly. The only thing holding me back are two parents, a brother, and a SO. It's like I'm holding onto a cliff when I'd rather fall. Not because I want to live, but because of the horrible mess I'd make. I feel my fingers slip a little more every day.

"2 months ago I posted hereTwo months ago I posted here with a needlessly long rant about how my whole life has been so insignificant and how my one chance at salvation would be a place at a university where I could simply pack my bags, fly across the country and start a new life in the company of complete strangers who might have mutual respect for one-another. Three weeks ago I learned that I didn't meet the grades, and then watched as all of the spare places for my chosen course filled up in a matter of hours. I have since been forced to stare powerless as my one chance to change my life for the better, to put to use the intelect that I have which many who even now unpack their possessions in the halls of residences across the country lack, fall beyond my reach. The same pretenders who in person knew but a fraction of accumilated knowledge that I had gained as was evident everytime I spoke with them, yet inexplicably acquired a plethora of straight A-grades and a secure space at some Ivy League or Oxbridge fraternity, are now the same undeserving bastards who have taken away everything from me. I cannot live a life in an apron and a paper hat, serving acrid grease and oozing fat to peons with belt sizes so great you could lasso a bull yak with bone marrow inflamation and still have room for more holes in the straps. The very knowledge that I have failed alone would constantly weigh me down. I may seem fine on the outside, but internally its torment that keeps mounting.. . My one regret, other than losing a chance at a new life, is that I couldn't simply buy any lethal medication over the counter and be done with it. It doesn't exactly matter though. I know the coastline well - I've read the charts - and I know the perfect cliffs that ought to be an exhilarating exit. I would have liked to have money for a train fare, but as I've been left with mere pennies, I shall have to walk: all 80 miles.

"I think I like this girl, and I think she likes me hi! I (14M, yes ik I'm a baby) have been to a couple of (socially distant) gathering recently with my classmates. There's this one girl who i havent seen since march last year that went to both of them. We both used to like each other a year or so ago, but we became nothing more than friends. For my sake, let's call her TK. . . Last year, we sometimes talked to each other in class and there was only sorta playful-insulting that we threw around but it wasn't with a bad intent, just 2 friends. Keep in mind we weren't very close. I always thought she was pretty attractive and since March I've had a big glow up, I've grown taller, voice changes and other puberty stuff. . . During dinner, she said I had really nice hands (which I've heard is a big compliment) and during both gatherings she wasn't doing any of the playful insulting like she was before, and she kept flirtatiously giggling at a lot of things I said, and TK couldn't hold eye contact for too long either. During that same dinner, we sat facing each other and I realised that this girl was surspringly cool and way different than I thought she was. I live in a middle Easter country with not too many cases so I could theoretically go on a few dates with her if we do end up having a romantic relationship. . . But here's the thing: we never talk online, and she is in a different group at school so we don't see each other at school. So my plan was to send TK a message saying hi or something on most days just to spark conversation. I was talking to my friend (13F) and she said that I shouldn't send her any funny videos or anything, or I might risk getting friendzoned, which has happened loads of times. I think I should just talk to her, then once I know she likes me, ill ask her out. . . Help would be appreciated reddit, and keep in mind we are all underage so don't write anything stupid. She also has arab parents so they might be strict.  What should I do? And does she like me? Peace out for now.",non-suicide

"scared.I grew up as a child prodigy: always getting perfect grades, singing locally and pre-professionally, and being every parent's dream. Now that I'm older and the stakes are higher I can't cope with the pressure and I'm crumbling. I just want to make my parents happy again but I can't even give that to them because I'm just a shitty person at my core. Some days like today I barely eat because everything feels so terrible that even the foods that give me a sliver of happiness taste like mush. Sometimes I bang my head against the wall hoping that a switch will click and I'll be the person that they want me to be. I've always been a people pleaser. I've always done what they wanted me to do, so now that I'm not who they want me to be anymore, I don't even know who ""me"" is. I'm not good at anything I used to be good at. All the special traits I had that made me *me* are gone. Now I'm just a failure. My mom and dad always say that they'll support me no matter what, but I know that they've given up on pushing me because they're scared I'll break. I've gained severe anxiety and almost depression from the amount of pressure my parents have placed on me, but it never was like I was doing what they wanted me to do against my own will. I knew  I was good at what I did, I wanted to be something they could be proud of. I wanted their compliments and humblebrags on Facebook about my newest achievements. I love them so much and I want them to be happy. They've always loved me, and I've taken it for granted. Now that the dynasty of being a child prodigy is over, I don't know who I am anymore, and it's terrifying. I push myself to stay alive everyday because if I comitted suicide I could never forgive myself for doing that to my parents. I could never cause them that emotional pain. I'm strong enough to keep myself afloat. That doesn't mean that I'm not sinking, though. Every day is a battle within myself to not just sleep all day and pretend that everything is fine when it's not fine and I just want it to be fine and I feel so stuck and all hope is fading and I just wanna be happy again without worrying about the eventual tsunami of sadness that comes with it.

I just wanna kms, but I'm too much of a pussy and that makes me feel even sadder. It's like losing at losing in life. It would be nice if there was a service that just did it for me. Off to fantasize about killing myself without ever doing it. RIP me, am I right? Probably just end up doing more drugs to make myself feel happy. This is a cry for help that I hope no one answers.

"Why shouldn’t I end it?So I’m a 21 year old female from Australia. I was diagnosed with autism when I was 3, anxiety and depression when I was 8, and BPD when I was 19. I went through the over-dramatic “I’m so depressed” phase in high school where I was dramatic suicidal like those emo girls you see on instagram. Now I’m just done. I’m thinking about it rationally, there may be no reason why I should stay alive...I’m a registered nurse, graduated last year but instead of finding a job I applied to do a secondary education degree so I’m back as a first year undergrad. But I’m ugly, I hate waking up, I hate eating, I sleep around 4 hours a night and when I take sleeping pills they work but they work for days after and I’m exhausted so I don’t take them. . . I’m ugly, I have zero social skills (literally, I can’t talk to people, when people talk to me off guard I just mumble and mutter random noises and I can’t say anything of meaning and I’ve never been able to have a conversation that didn’t include a million misunderstandings. I live  with my parents and younger siblings, I can’t stand them, they seemingly can’t stand me. I have no future, I’ll never get married bc I have no social skills I have absolutely no friends, I don’t know anybody and I can’t commit to anything. All that “it get’s better” crap doesn’t apply to me because it’s only getting worse. I have the WORST luck with psychiatrists and psychologists, they cancel on me, they always go off topic, they simply tell me they can’t help me. I’ve been on a million psych meds, they didn’t make me worse, but they didn’t make me better either, it’s like I wasn’t even taking them. . . All I want is at least one good friend, marry a Christian man, have a few kids. But nobody will ever be attracted to me. Some people think I’m a boy even but I don’t want to change my appearance and I’m worried that if a man was ever attracted to me that he’d actually be gay and he could only stand me bc I look like a boy but really he’s just using me as his closet doors......the only reason I can think of to not do it is that MAYBE i’ll get the life I dream of one day, but “maybe” doesn’t seem worth it, because more than likely I’ll keep living my life like this and die and lonely old hag in my bed and be found a week later when the mail starts piling up outside.

"I think I’m gonna stop doing stuff with friends for my birthday I think after the fifth grade I stopped having birthday parties, and I wasn’t invited to many either, mainly because I moved to a new state and didn’t have many friends, so I just had a nice dinner with my family at a steakhouse or something on my birthday. In eighth grade I found a new friend group and went to their bday and stuff. In ninth grade and I a bday “party” after four years of not doing much for my birthday. We went to Main Event and ate at CPK with my closest friends, but it didn’t really feel that exciting anymore. I think at some point you just grow too old for that sort of stuff.

"Not an interseting titleJust wanted to write about my feelings. There won't be any point in this text, just some thoughts of mine in a random order. Writing things and ideas down helps me to understand myself better.. . I'm living a picture-perfect life. Great social life: a lot of acquaintances, a few close friends and good and healthy family relationships. Nothing seems to be wrong with me either. Overall healthy lifestyle, a bit of studying daily and two jobs that I don't stress about at all. All of this unfortunately means nothing to me. I just don't see the point. Never had seen. It's like an existential crisis which has been going on for my entire life. I know I shouldn't take my privileged life as granted and definitely shouldn't feel depressed or indifferent when I practically have potential to live my life however I want. All these opportunities and I choose to think about suicide. Makes no sense. . . The more I think about suicide, the more it tempts me. Firstly, I really don't want to live so suicide sounds like a solution. Secondly, the Earth doesn't need me (actually doesn't need any of us) and society neither. I'm just doing my part destroying our nature and making expenses to the society. That's the truth lol. My friends don't need me either. They will continue living their life doesn't matter if I was alive or not. I understand that of course I have an impact in their lives and my suicide would be a shock to them and it would cause unnecessary misery but let's say like in two, five or ten years it wouldn't affect their lives at all. And I'm not living my life just to keep my friends happy. That would be selfish from them. Only thing that keeps me alive is my parents. They are really good people and I want only the best for them.

Was my problem never finding a good hobby in my youth? Was my problem not pursuing the hobbies I already had for a career path? Was my problem my inability to connect with anyone I talk to?

I've been cheated on in the past by another boyfriend, and had insecurities about it happening again, but I had never snooped on his phone or anything as I fully trusted him. I had found the condom because he had a cold and was leaving tissues in all his pockets, and I was putting a wash on. I couldn't believe it, I just never expected it from him. Our relationship seemed solid and we had a great sex life. . . I was unaware he had any mental health issues, and chalked his infidelity up to him not valuing me or the relationship, so I stormed out of the house after some very bitter words and went to stay with a friend. I found him the next morning. . . At his inquest I learnt he had been suicidal once before (before we met) and had taken himself to a&amp;e but been fobbed off with valium. I also found out he had been diagnosed in 2006 with generalised anxiety disorder which he had not sought or received therapy or medication for. . . His sister asked me a very difficult question - she said ""do you think he thought your relationship was over?"". The implication there is that he killed himself because he thought our relationship was over, and I think he must have assumed it was... And that's my fault. I had privately decided to seek a couple's counsellor and to see if we could make it work but I didn't tell him that straight away as I thought he needed to see that he had risked losing me by cheating. I was trying to future proof our relationship by making him think he'd fucked it because I didn't want him to do it again. I travel a lot for work and was terrified he would feel like he could do it again. Needless to say I hate myself for letting him believe it was over. All I can say is I was blinded by my own hurt and never imagined he would do something like this. . . I want to know if any of you have been suicidal after a break up or if it's always a culmination of factors? I know it often happens after breakups, but is that why? He died 12 hours after I had found the condom. He had started googling methods the second I left the house (twenty minutes after finding it and confronting him). If our relationship was life or death  to him, why lay it on the line for the cheapest hooker he could find, just days after completing on our house? I dont understand! Have any of you got generalised anxiety disorder? What is that like? . . I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to ask these questions. I'm just so devastated to have lost him. I'm so sorry I let him believe it was over. I had no idea he would do this. It's been four months and his pain is all I think about, but I don't fully understand what was going on. . . . ",suicide

"I almost died today. I WANT TO KEEP LIVING AND SO DO YOU.Hello reddit. Today I almost died. I'm still in quite a shock, but I believe I must share what I learned with you all.. Sorry for the wall of text, but do read my story, I hope it may help you somehow.. . Long story short about my past:. I was a cutter from 13 to 16. Back then all I wanted was to die, but didn't have the guts to do it. Of course, when I was 16 years old I cut myself severely and after a while I decided that, even though my life had many problems, cutting and thinking about death wouldn't solve anything.. . All this time I had a very dedicated psychologist. She helped me through all the process.. A year ago, 21 years old, I went through a very traumatic experience and I simply wasn't coping with it. After some time my psychologist decided I should see a shrink to get me on meds.. I did as she said and it wasn't too long until I went back to cutting.. The problem, however, was that this time I REALLY wanted to kill myself. I overdosed while drunk twice, I was also taken to the hospital due to severe cutting (that night especially I didn't think anyone would find me... I wanted to bleed to death, but anyway... doesn't matter), etc etc etc.... I was on the verge (and still am) of being institutionalized due to this behavior.. . I've been thinking about killing myself for a long time now. The only reason that keeps me going is my mother. I lived just not to break her heart.. . ----. . SO TODAY I was mad at absolutely everything over some really stupid shit. I was supposed to meet my best friend but texted him to cancel it, since I wasn't in the mood. I was going to buy a new razor and cut myself again.. My best friend called me before reading the text, saying he was already on his way to meet me so I decided to go, warning him I was in a really bad mood.. . We eventually got drunk. He really cheered me up, so I decided I would be on my way home, have dinner and go to bed... again to wait for ANOTHER POINTLESS DAY... How lame.... . So we were on our way home and, in our drunk wisdom, we thought it was a GREAT idea to take a walk in a pontoon (a floating dock, wtv) by the river (a very disgusting and smelly one, by the way).. . We were drunk. It was dark. It was cold (yeah, it's winter). There were barely no lights. I remember reading a sign saying something like ""warning, don't cross, danger of falling in the river"". I thought to myself ""yeah, right!"". . So we were in the middle, I notice I was getting off balance, so I turned back to be in balance again. There were pretty big spaces between the steps, but I never thought they would be enough for me to fall in the water... in fact... I thought if I fell there would be some kind of platform before reaching the water. YEAH RIGHT.. . I fell.. I was underwater for about... ten seconds(?)... but it seemed like hours... I can't even describe.. I didn't really understand what was going on, neither had I any sense whether I was upside down or not. The only thing I realized was that I was going down fast and that I wanted to swim up.. That was the only thing I cared about. I wanted to go up up up up!!!. . So finally I see my friend, hanging like a monkey or something, trying desperately to save me. I had two books in my hands and I think he told me to forget about them. No way sir, books must be saved. I threw the books as far as I could so they could reach safe ground and then came the hardest part... Me getting out of there.. . I was really deep. There was NO ONE around: NO ONE. I was losing strength, my friend tried to pull me up and I hit with my head twice on that damned dock and fell again.. At this point he thought I was giving up, so he kept insisting that I had to be strong, to hold his hand, to keep trying.. I wasn't giving up. I was of course just half awake, losing my grip, but never did giving up passed through my mind. I just needed to calm down and get a grip.. So I finally get enough strength to get my legs on a little step and my friend did the rest. Pulled me and I was finally safe.. . I was dizzy. I wasn't sure of what I was feeling. Now I know. I realized: I don't want to die.. I could have died. My friend could have not been able to help me, there was no one around, it was dark, it was cold, I didn't even know what was going on.. When I realized I lived... Guys, I mean it.... I don't want to die anymore.. It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter how much you suffer. There is nothing as pointless as a ridiculous death. You may think you are unworthy, unloved, living a pointless life,... Well, maybe you are going through some tough shit and believe me, I know what you feel like.. . But understand when I tell you this:. When you are about to die the only thing that goes through your head is living. If you are thinking about taking your life right now remember this. You will want to live. BELIEVE ME: YOU WILL! All of us want to live even if we don't know it. When the time comes... earlier than what it should... all you want is to live another day, see another sunset, smile at someone you love.. . Guys, don't do it. No matter how hard it is, there is always a way. For me, as ridiculous as it can be, this incident made me realize how much I actually love my life and the ones in it.. . It is worth it :) Be strong people!. . With love.",suicide

I was held back by the thought that if I did it, she would too but she will be able to get through this. She confirmed that when I kind of brought it up a while ago. I've spent a lot of my life worrying about others feeling and emotions. And finally I think this time I just have to be thinking of myself. I'm not trying to make this a selfish decision but at some point, I have to look out for myself too. I've always been a kind person, and you know where it got me? Well. Here I guess. Just fuck it all. ",suicide

"Reposting this when more people are awake so I get more feedback Humanity settled on a planet in the near future, but this planet has a longer distance from the sun, so they can't rely on solar power, so they slowly mine the planet for resources, flooding the atmosphere with carbon dioxide, to keep people from leaving the planet, corporations sign contracts with employees, promising them big land and wealth for their family a couple generations down, people invent biomekanical beings to help do work, lighter than air squid like creatures called carbon scrubbers are sent into the sky to eat carbon and produce oxygen, soon enough everyone starts using biomekanical machines. The more machines need to keep the atmosphere breathable, the more people are needed to stay for longer, perpetuating a cycle of endless slavery, class separation is being to be encouraged, as to not hint to the plan of slavery, and the people become content, not knowing that the very machines keeping them alive, are keeping them imprisoned.",non-suicide

"I have a somewhat simple thought. Instead of samurai mastering the blade. What if they mastered the gun. Basically I’m thinking, feudal Japan has the musket and gunpowder introduced and instead of samurai being trained in the way of the blade they instead learn to use the muskets. And they get to a point where they are basically sniper with them. Just masters of it. And Japan become full of gun slinging samurai and Ronan. And yeah the weapon would trickle down to the lower levels of soldiers but they don’t have the skill and mastery of men trained from birth to use the weapon. The rifles are beautiful, masterfully made, engraved with the finest of engravings, common for houses to hand them down generation to generation. And then men can hit a flying dove from at least 500 meters. There would be other guns too not just long rang rifles. Some would carry blunderbusses, some multiple pistols. . .

"I won't wait any longer.I feel the urge to kill myself next week.Not joking.Hello people form Reddit. This is a repost because I mispelled the title.Sorry for the one who replied me.. . The only thing I wanted to say is that I've been walking around after college and saw a perfect place for ending my life. I don't want anything back from life. Not even jerking off. I don't even want to talk.I don't want to do anything.I'm tired of this life. It could sound kind of sad when it comes from a person at such a young age.Almost a moment ago I've come to the conclusion that I'll end up my life without ever having known what love is.Giving it to someone and being given back.Also having sex, something apparently impossible for me right now.Any changes physically don't do anything.I'm actually fine.Not too good but fine. Don't try to bullshit me with ""make a better version of yourself"".I'm good-looking and quite handsome.Not something extraordinary but yes, honestly, I am.. . I'm also tired of feeling loneliness and seeing how my family and the house we live physically falls apart in every way.I'm starting to hate my parents who don't give a shit about their children.All the fucking day smoking weed (my mother), tobacco (both) and drinking alcohol (my father). My house is a disaster and a complete mess-up. Everything is untidy or decaying. We have a leak on the ceiling of my bedroom but nobody fucking cares.I can't concentrate on anything inside that shitty house. I'm having academic problems as well.I've lost completely motivation.I don't give a shit.I'm just here procrastinating because I can't focus on anything.I want to cry all the fucking time but I don't find the moment because I have no privacy in this house. You can't even imagine how much I want to cry out.To let this out.All I have inside bottled up will suddenly burst out and by then you could be thinking of the worst.. . I want to get a job or whatever but I don't know how to do a resume nor getting it .Like how come I get one? Where? I have no experience.I'm socially inept.I'm the worst.Why should someone hire me up? I see no future possible for me.The financial conditions in my country are just the worst for a youngster.If you're not the best in your field, fuck you! That's how it works.And that's what I'll do.Because they're forcing me to kill myself as I don't see any other way out.People who have a job complaining about shitty resumes inexperienced guys are trying to submit in order to fucking get a crappy job consisting in doing the dishes at a restaurant.That's what getting a job htese days is about.Guess what? You can get that job and stick it up your ass! (where the moon doesn't shine??)Competitiveness is wilder than ever.This is more than a jungle.I hope all this shit set up falls apart by itself and dies.. . I'm also tired of my sexual orientation and sexuality, in general.. Tired of not being able to do anything because of my shyness.I Because I don't know how to date.Because I don't even know what I want out of life as a whole.I don't know if dating a guy is a good idea, even though I crave it more than anything.I want to have a family.It's contradictory, I know. However, I would come out as gay if I knew that my entire family wouldn't disown me nor reject me.Becuase above all things on Earth, the only thing I couldn't put up with, is my family not accepting me.I wouldn't care that much about others.I'm really scared, anxious, angsty, overcome, overwhelmed, burnt out... I've been lately more mournful than I've ever been.Nobody noticed it and they do well.It's just my business not theirs.I am not going to turn to anybody and whining while speaking about it.I am not going to. What I'll do is end it all.. . I'm just a step away from death.I can actually feel the end of pain and some sort of relief.

"I feel selfish for not wanting to live.I'm not sure why I'm writing this here.

I'm in my first year of university, I live with my parents, and I have good grades. I have a career picked and the path to it planned. But nothing makes me truly happy, I worry all of the time about everything, I never sleep anymore and I either over-eat at times or barely eat. . . Although my life is decent on the outside, it feels like a prison. I feel selfish for not wanting to be alive anymore, I know people have it way worst than me. Often times, I'm stressed for no reason and my stomach and head aches in pain. I'm 18 and hating a decent life. . . Moving to a different country, losing friends because they found better friends, forcing myself to lose weight by puking, excessive exercising and barely eating, being sad all of the time and worrying about every bad scenario possible, being so shy and nervous that I get panic attacks at the thought of speaking to people and always being at home, has really just driven me to this point. Not to mention, my mom has used the $7000 in my account to invest in stocks. And someone I thought cared about me, doesn't even see me in their future. I feel controlled. . .

I'm stupid, pathetic, ugly, there is no reason at all for my existence and there never will be.. . I don't really love anyone, I love my parents I guess but mostly just because I feel sorry for them that they had such a fuck up like me. For a while I thought I was gay because I didn't like girls, but it turns out I don't like guys either. I don't like anyone and I don't feel anything and I have no friends and even though that's who I am and how I like it, in the back of my mind I still want to feel like a part of something and be liked.. I can't see myself having a family or whatever in the future though... I can't see myself at all really. What's the point? My time is here I think. I don't know what to say. I'm already dead inside, I only need to get rid of this empty shelled abomination and I really think I might. I'm so close.

No matter how it's presented to me, the concept of coping isn't enough to get me out of this...it worries me more, if anything. I won't go on and on to explain why I'm suicidal, or why I, I guess, use the thought of suicide. I can't explain it all that well, anyway.

"To all those out there who are really struggling right now... I’ve never posted here before but I feel there are a lot of people who could use a few words to help them, and from someone who isn’t just your parents, but a fellow teen among you all. Because I sure know I needed it.. . The last 6 months have been the worst that I can recall. Being a 19 year old male, I was still recovering from the “post-graduation depression” that some people go through, in the process loosing contact with most of my friends. Having to deal with drama in family politics and having to be the only voice of reason because everyone is too f**king immature to resolve anything. Being stressed out about my parents constantly telling me that I need to do something with my life didn’t help either. Then quarantine happened, and I ended up getting dumped by the girl that I loved.. . Safe to say I was a mess.. . I had sunk into depression and had no drive to do anything, I wanted to quit and just stop hurting. To lie down, go to sleep, and not wake up. But I’d come to the realization that sulking over my breakup and just wishing things would be better won’t fix anything. I faced my demons head on and resolved my problems with my now ex, I had a friend who helped me start to move on (who I cannot express more gratitude for), I told my family that I’m done with their drama, partially moved out of my parents house, and I got a job offer that can actually lead into a career. Things are finally looking up for me.. . While I still may be hurting, I know that the actions I have taken are best for my own health and well being. . . The point I’m trying to make here is that no matter how much things may hurt, no matter how much life throws at you, and no matter how much you want to quit, there is always something you can do to make things better for yourself. I know that majority of the users on this subreddit are younger than me, and while I may not have a lot of life experience, these last few months have really opened my eyes. For everyone that is struggling with something, things will get better. Your life has just begun and for all of us, sh*t is just starting. . . You will find something to do with your life. You don’t need to let people drag you down . You will find happiness if you feel you’ve lost it. You always have someone who will look out for you. You will find someone else. You will be great . .
